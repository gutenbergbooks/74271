</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of these stories were written more
than a dozen years ago. They have been
gathered in from the Atlantic Monthly, Harper’s
Bazar, Outing, the Independent, the
Delineator, the Chicago Tribune, the late
Chicago Graphic, and Lippincott’s Magazine,
by courteous permission of the editors;
and revised year after year. Many of them
embody phases of American life which have
entirely passed away, or are yet to be found
in secluded spots like eddies along the margin
of the nation’s progress. Their honest
preservation of middle western experience
makes them, at least in the author’s eyes,
seem worthy themselves of preservation.</p>

<p>The Puritan and the Church of England
took possession of the Atlantic seaboard,
north and south; and Jesuit and Recollet
missionaries carried the cross through Canada
and down the Mississippi. But the pioneer
evangelist of the Middle West was the
Methodist itinerant.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tiny">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1846</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Christmas Day a large congregation
poured from George’s Chapel into the early
dusk. Quarterly meeting, which for a week
had drawn together, not only the neighborhood,
but people from Millersport, Basil,
and even Kirkersville, closed that afternoon.
The presiding elder and his assistants were
wrapping up their throats and joking with
each other, for the occasion had been blessed
with converts and a fairly liberal collection.</p>

<p>These men must ride on around the circuit,
risking health, and accepting whatever
fell to their lot, yet nothing checked their
flow of spirits. The only solemn person
near the group was Mr. Warner, a local
preacher and exhorter, who habitually prayed
with a war-whoop, and kept the young people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
tittering at his pompous phrases. His father,
an aged apparition, tottering on a
stick, was circulating genially to shake
every hand, known or unknown, and inquire,
toothlessly, “Hi-ya! hi-ya! how’s
your consarn?” which being interpreted
meant, “How are you, how are you, how’s
your concern?” (in religion).</p>

<p>Women clustered together near the red-hot
stove, exclaiming to each other, as their
work-worn palms met, “Hoddy-do, Mis’
Waddell, does your family keep well?”
and “Law! Mis’ Davis, it’s good for sore
eyes to see you out to meetin’ once more!”
“Yes, I been kept close all fall, but I told
him it wouldn’t do, we must come to big
meetin’.” “It’s been a good time. One
o’ my boys,” the speaker pressing her neighbor’s
hand, “was gathered in, and I have
my suspicions the other’s touched.” “Yes,
there’s more under conviction than’ll own
to it.”</p>

<p>They made excuses to each other for
neglecting neighborly duties in the past, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
promised, now such good sleighin’ had set
in, to go more. One had had whooping-cough
in her family, another a teething
baby, and not a few had been very busy
getting the butchering done and making
sausage. The men-folks were also constantly
hauling with the teams.</p>

<p>Warm Christian feeling pervaded the
whole separating assembly, even the young
girls greeting each other with unusual affection.
The young men drove their conveyances
up to the door, exchanging merry
remarks; there were many fine horses, and
some of the sleighs were painted, but the
general vehicle was a wagon-bed, stuffed
with straw and comforters, and running on
two short sleds called “bobs.”</p>

<p>Theophilus Gill’s sleigh was of this pattern,
and he intended to drive the young
folks to Macauley’s. His spirited team
pranced so that he stood up to control it,
though at full height Theophilus Gill was
but a little fellow. He had, however, a
strong black beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“How many goin’ in our load, Theoph?”
inquired Philip Welchammer, resting one
foot on the forward runner.</p>

<p>“’Bout ten couple. Mart, he’s got to
take his mother home, so he won’t be
along.”</p>

<p>“You feel like as if you could spare
him?”</p>

<p>“I always ken. Now, don’t you go to cut
me out if I try to engage her company for
Sunday night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you and Mart fer it,” said Philip.
“I ain’t fer cuttin’ neither of ye out. But
Persilla Thompson’s a pretty girl.”</p>

<p>“She’s the Queen of the Swamp,” said
little Gill, with emphasis.</p>

<p>Priscilla at this moment stepped down
from the chapel threshold into the snow, to
wait for her party. Philip brought her to
the sled and Gill insisted on placing her in
a warm and sheltered place just behind the
driver’s bench, which he had specially prepared
for her.</p>

<p>“Macauley’s is makin’ a big house-warmin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> 
this Chris’mas,” remarked Priscilla’s
little suitor to her. “They’s four
tables full of old folks to their turkey-roast,
and the young folks all invited in the evenin’.
I reckon the old lady’s doin’ it for Mart.
She’s bound for him to marry that Miller
girl, some says.”</p>

<p>Priscilla replied, with pleasant nonchalance,
she reckoned so. She did not look
at Mart Macauley at all, but she saw him
watching her while he untied his bay filly,
and held its head until his mother finished
talking with her dinner guests.</p>

<p>He had loved Priscilla Thompson when
she was a little girl with black plaits of hair
hanging down her linsey back. In those
days he gave her a bead purse, and whipped
all her tormentors. When she began to be
a big girl he shyly courted her, stopping his
plough by the fence if he saw her coming,
and dropping in of a Sunday night to see
her brother, whom he despised, and who had
since married and left him without excuse
for his visits. When she got a certificate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and went into the Kemmerer neighborhood
to teach school, with her clothes neatly
packed in a large wicker basket, he had no
peace of mind all summer. He had himself
been to Worthington to college, but in all
his experience saw no one to compare with
her. Wherever he saw her, so modest and
lovely in manner, he cherished the ground
her shoes rested on. The cold air gave her
a bright color, which the depth and length
of her bonnet could not conceal. She wore
a wadded alpaca cloak and cloak cape, and
Martin’s memory showed him how trimly
under these her delaine dress was coat-sleeved
to her arm and pointed at her
waist.</p>

<p>Mrs. Macauley, climbing into her own
sleigh, could take no exceptions to Priscilla
Thompson’s manner or appearance, though
she would have done so gladly for the benefit
of her favorite son. Mrs. Macauley disliked
the Thompsons. Her husband before
his death objected to them. She thought
little Theophilus Gill the best match in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
neighborhood for Priscilla Thompson. Her
own large light-haired son was too dutiful
to marry without her consent. She was
educating him to be a doctor; the younger
boys could work the farm under her direction.
She expected Martin to do his family
credit by looking higher than the Thompsons.</p>

<p>Priscilla, on her part, held Mrs. Macauley
in secret aversion. She felt sorry for Martin’s
younger brothers and sisters, who were
all obliged to stand in a row and take pills
or tincture before breakfast. Mrs. Macauley
was too high-handed and all-prevailing.
Priscilla’s disposition was cheerful, but that
Ohio region known as the Swamp could not
escape the tinge of the period, and at that
date the extremely feminine woman with a
bias toward melancholy was the standard.
Mrs. Macauley was so mannish that Priscilla
thought her fully entitled to the tufts
of beard in her moles.</p>

<p>The young people crowded merrily into
Theophilus Gill’s sled. They all knew how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
matters stood between the Macauleys and
Thompsons. The Thompsons, excepting
Priscilla, who was a reticent girl, talked
about the Macauleys, and the Macauleys
held their heads rather high, excepting
Mart; but he thought the world of his
mother. The girls suspected Priscilla was
going to-night because her staying away
would make talk. Some of them believed
Theophilus Gill would get her, and others
thought things might take a turn so that
she would marry Mart Macauley after all.</p>

<p>There was a day when she would have
given half her life to go to Macauley’s, but
stayed away. That was when Martin broke
his collar-bone racing his bay filly. Nobody
knew that she hid in her father’s
field corn-crib all that day. Yet it was not
an occasion for extravagant fears. Mrs.
Macauley was the best nurse in Fairfield
County, and soon had her son mended to
perfection.</p>

<p>A few flakes of snow fell on Gill’s load,
and made it all the merrier. No joke could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
fail to strike fire at once on the steel-clear
air, and many a time-honored one was repeated
by the young men as their fathers
before them had repeated it, and enjoyed by
the girls as their mothers had enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Philip Welchammer was pitied for having
his arm out of place, and Nora Waddell,
discovering it at that instant around
her, told him tartly there <i>is</i> folks that their
room’s better than their comp’ny. Upon
this he genially retorted that she never
made no such fuss when they were out
sleigh-ridin’ alone; and Nora glowed in her
red merino hood while the laugh turned
upon her.</p>

<p>Then a girl’s voice, to cover her confusion,
started a thrilling old revival hymn,
and the load poured its bass and treble
through the lines. Darkness approached as
near as the white world would allow. The
triumphant strain echoed among treetops
and stirred emotion in Priscilla.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“There, there on eagles’ wings I soar,</div>
<div class="verse">And sense and sin are felt no more.</div>
<div class="verse">There heaven comes down our souls to greet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></div>
<div class="verse">And glory crowns the Mercy Seat—</div>
<div class="verse">And glo-ry crowns the Mer-cy Seat.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The road was bounded by that distinctively
American fence, the rail, or stake-and-ridered,
showing drifts of snow in its angles,
and white lines like illuminations along the
top of every lichened rail. The sled flew
over corduroy spaces now deeply bedded.
On each side the trees rose out of frozen
pools, from which they seemed to conduct
a glazed coating upward, for every twig
glinted icily through the dusk. In spring-time,
when the Feeder and creek rose out
of banks, acres of this swamp lay under
water, with moss scum and rotting leaves at
the top and bottom.</p>

<p>Priscilla found always in these woods a
solemn beauty. Her wildest dream was of
living deep in their summer shade with an
unnamed person, and sitting on the doorstep
at nightfall, her hand locked in his.
The amber lights, the cry of tree-frog and
locust, the mysterious snap of twigs, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
reverberating bark of a dog, the ceaseless
motion of water under a foot-log, all gave
her delight. One spring she worked in her
father’s sugar-camp. A bark shelter that
they passed reminded her of it, of collecting
the sugar-water, watching the bubbling
kettles, and dropping the wax on snow, of
stirring-off, which was such a festival, and
at the same time such a miracle, for you
could feel the hardening wax grain to sugar
on your tongue.</p>

<p>Theophilus Gill turned his horses from
the road, and drove through a gap into the
woods.</p>

<p>“What are you doin’ that for?” exclaimed
John Davis, who loved a horse,
like every good Ohio man, but was always
ready to sacrifice it to his comfort or
speed.</p>

<p>Theophilus explained there was a bad bit
of road ahead, and the circuit through the
woods might be better.</p>

<p>If he dreaded cutting his team’s ankles,
the danger was not lessened by this choice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of routes. For after some easy progress
and much winding among saplings and jarring
against stumps, they descended to a
seldom-used bridge across the Feeder, standing
like an island in a frozen lake. Theophilus
Gill drew up his horses. There
was not room in which to turn back, and
the occupants of the sled rose with some
apprehension.</p>

<p>Nora Waddell said she would never go
over that bridge. Theophilus observed
doubtfully he’d risk gettin’ the team across,
but mebby some of the boys had better
walk over and lighten the load.</p>

<p>Everybody alighted except the driver,
who cautiously, and reassuring his snorting
horses, moved across the ice and up the
bridge. It shook under their tread to such
a degree that nearly all the party resolved
to trust the ice in preference, and pushed
their tracks carefully upon the snow-covered
Feeder. Besides Nora Waddell, Philip
Welchammer took under his charge Mary
Thompson, Priscilla’s flighty young sister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
who was barely fifteen and in short dresses,
but so headstrong that she would go into
company whenever Priscilla did. Starts
and exclamations were finally blended into
a general outcry, for the ice gave way, and
several figures disappeared to their very
necks. Then the young men who had
landed were prompt in action, while some of
the girls showed courage and pioneer swiftness
of resource. Philip and his two companions
were pulled out, and huddled, dripping,
into the sled, all available covering
being piled upon them. Everybody scrambled
in, and Theophilus, restraining his
horses, asked, in an excited shout, if they
were all in. Mary Thompson, through her
chattering teeth, retorted, “Of course all of
us were in, and if he did not mean to kill us
entirely, he’d better whip up and get to
some fireplace.”</p>

<p>Thus reproached, and by the Swamp
Queen’s sister, the young man drove with
such zeal that his horses ran away, and
were restrained from tearing the vehicle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to bits against logs and fences only by his
utmost strength and horsemanship.</p>

<p>Thus the party came like a whirlwind
up the open lane to Macauley’s, and were
hurried into the three-story house, while
Macauley’s boys led the horses away to a
barn of similar magnitude, where long rows
of stalls and shining flanks were discernible
by lantern-light.</p>

<p>No less than three fireplaces had blazing
logs piled to the very chimney throats.
Sarah Macauley conducted the girls upstairs
to the best room, from which opened
a bedchamber where they laid off their
wraps. The young men found a similar
haven on the other side of the staircase.
And it was pleasant to hear the logs snap
while frost lay so thick on the two upper
porches which were let into the sides of the
house.</p>

<p>Macauleys were very well off indeed.
The estate consisted of fifteen thousand
dollars cash, besides a couple of farms, and
the largest homestead in the township. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Macauley had accumulated all this, after
breaking up twice during his career, paying
security debts. Nearly all the floors were
carpeted in home-made stripe or hit-or-miss,
and the best beds reared backs as lofty and
imposing as the backs of elephants.</p>

<p>Numbers of young women, arrived before
this party, were basking in the best room,
their hair and collars smoothed, and their
eyes taking keen neighborly notes while the
hum of conversation went on. Miss Miller
from Millersport was there, and appeared a
worthy rival for Priscilla Thompson. She
had pink cheeks, and pretty brown hair on
a low, delicate forehead, these charms being
distractingly set in an all-wool blue merino
dress and ribbon headdress to match. Miss
Miller possessed two thousand dollars in her
own right, and would come in for all her
father’s property when he died. Besides,
she had attended select school in Lancaster,
and some said she was so fine she would cut
a bean in two rather than lift the whole of
it on the point of her knife to her very
pretty mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Mrs. Macauley lost not an instant in dosing
her drenched guests with hot whiskey
and ginger stew. Other raiment was provided
for them. When all the young people
had arrived and warmed themselves,
they were to descend to the dining-room,
one of the largest apartments ever seen in
those days, supported by a row of posts
across the centre, and floored by oak as
smooth as glass. The name of kitchen
would have fitted it as well, for here the
family cooked. One of those new-fashioned
iron machines called stoves stood beside the
fireplace, having a pipe to carry its smoke
into the chimney. But Mrs. Macauley often
said it was not half as much use to her as
the Dutch ovens she always baked in, over
the coals.</p>

<p>A line of chairs waited around the sides
of the dining-room. The pantry, opening
at one end, half revealed stacks of Christmas
provisions on shelves.</p>

<p>But there was to be no such godless
amusement as dancing. The young people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
would frolic and play plays with kissing
penalties, which could by no means corrupt
them as much as joining hands and jumping
to the tune of a fiddle.</p>

<p>Groups were already descending to the
dining-room, and Mary Thompson struggled
hard to hook one of Sarah Macauley’s
dresses over her stouter waist.</p>

<p>“Your sister didn’t come?” remarked
Sarah politely, in the modulated voice that
her mother trained.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did,” exclaimed Mary. “She
was along with the load. Why, where is
Persill?”</p>

<p>This inquiry at once became general.
Priscilla was nowhere in the house. The
panic-stricken company could not remember
seeing her since crossing the Feeder.
They all thought she returned to the sled
with them. John Davis was sure he helped
her in.</p>

<p>Theophilus Gill, turning livid around the
edges of his beard, said the horses might
have gone to Jericho for all of him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
he’d ’tended to Persilla Thompson himself
if he had known the rest of the boys wasn’t
goin’ to. Priscilla’s sister began to cry
aloud, and such young ladies as did not
accompany her gazed at each other in pale
apprehension. But Mrs. Macauley came
sternly to the front. She would not allow
Mary Thompson to proclaim that Priscilla
was drowned, and Theoph Gill had done it,
and she forbade the party falling into a
panic.</p>

<p>Her son Martin had his filly and sleigh
ready, and while she snatched blankets and
brandy, she marshaled forth such young
men to form a separate search party as
seemed suitable in her eyes. Mrs. Macauley
would not have Priscilla Thompson
drowned in the Feeder, and left strict orders
on her own offspring against any such impression—which
the whole company obeyed.
Then she got into the sleigh, and Mart galloped
his filly.</p>

<p>He made but one remark to his mother
during this ride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“If she’d come along with us as <i>I</i>
wanted her to, this wouldn’t have happened,
mother!”</p>

<p>His face showed ghastly through the
dark, and his husky voice jarred the breast
of the woman who bore him.</p>

<p>The sleigh and the sled containing the
young men both stopped at that unused
bridge standing in the midst of the Feeder.
They all called Priscilla’s name, the winter
night’s stillness magnifying the sound. And
for reply they had a void of silence.</p>

<p>Mart was for dropping into the hole and
searching under the ice, but his mother
sternly restrained him. She sent the young
men down stream, and she walked across
the bridge with her son, separating from
him afterward that they might search the
woods in different directions.</p>

<p>Down the Feeder, men’s voices raised
melancholy echoes—“Persilla! Hoo-o-o,
Persil-la! Persilla Thompson!”</p>

<p>The solemn winter woods could not daunt
Mrs. Macauley. She gave no nervous start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
at twigs snapping under the snow-crust, but
searched large spaces with vigor. It did
hurt her to hear Mart calling the girl in
such a tone, and to remember what he had
said to his mother. In those days people
weighed their words, and every sentence
meant something. Martin’s slight reproach
to Mrs. Macauley was the first he had ever
uttered.</p>

<p>Treading among naked saplings, with
now and then a ghostly pawpaw leaf rustling
against her face, she came to the bark
sugar-house, and met Mart at its open side,
carrying Priscilla in his arms. Priscilla
was too terrified and exhausted to speak
aloud, having crept out of the Feeder as far
as this shelter. Icicles hung to her clothing,
and she had lost her bonnet and cloak cape.
She clung around Mrs. Macauley’s neck,
crying like a baby, and very unlike the
dignified young woman that her small circle
had always considered her. Perhaps this
softness had its effect on a nature bent on
commanding and protecting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>In half an hour the young folks at Macauley’s
knew that Mart’s mother brought
Priscilla home on her lap, wrapped in blankets,
and dosed with brandy every few rods.
The searchers in the sled, arriving but little
later, said Priscilla must have been clear
under the ice by the looks of it where she
crept out. But the Feeder was so shallow
right there that she could walk on the bottom.</p>

<p>All festivity remained suspended while
the hostess, like some mysterious medicine-woman,
worked over her patient. A few
groups in the dining-room played “fist’ock,”
and other very mild sitting diversions which
could be suspended in an instant, the players
looking up with concern to receive the
latest bulletin from Priscilla.</p>

<p>But she recovered so rapidly that every
spirit rose, as did the general opinion of
Mrs. Macauley’s skill. John Davis remarked
staidly to Darius Macauley that he
believed Darius’s mother knew more about
doctorin’ horses, even, than most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
horse doctors in the country, but Darius replied
with some grimness, she wasn’t settin’
up for that.</p>

<p>Finally Priscilla was able to come downstairs,
holding to Mart’s arm, and helped on
the other side by his mother, and everybody
said they entered the dining-room like a
bridal couple about to stand up, for she was
pale and handsome enough to be a bride,
and he looked scared and anxious enough to
be a groom. Priscilla made the effort to
come down, not only because Mrs. Macauley
considered her sufficiently restored to do so,
but also because she did not want to check
the merriment of the party.</p>

<p>They put her in a large chair against one
of the central posts, and Sarah Macauley, as
soon as she could catch breath for surprise,
exclaimed, loud enough to be heard by all
around her, though fortunately not by the
head of the family:—</p>

<p>“Why, mother! you’ve put that flowered
silk dress on her that father brought you
from Philadelphia when he went over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
mountains with a drove of horses! You
said you was goin’ to save that for the oldest
son’s wife.”</p>

<p>The guests near Sarah looked significantly
at each other, and Miss Miller, being among
them, tossed her head and tittered.</p>

<p>“Anybody who was <i>anxious</i> to marry
into your family,” she remarked to Sarah,
“ought to fall sick and send for your mother,
and give her all the trouble in the
world. That’s the surest way to get her
consent.”</p>

<p>Miss Miller pursed her lips. She wanted
to correct any impression that she had favored
Mart Macauley, and at the same time
utter a few strictures.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother’s a good nurse,” said Sarah
innocently.</p>

<p>“She’ll nurse <i>you</i>,” whispered Darius,
with a warning nudge, “when she hears
what you said about that flowered silk.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell her,” begged his sister. “I’ll
do your share of the milkin’ all the rest of
the week, if you won’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Well,” assented Darius provisionally,
“mebby I won’t.”</p>

<p>The flowered silk had been constructed
for Mrs. Macauley when she was much less
matronly in shape than on this Christmas
night, and by reason of being put away so
long had got into fashion again. It was so
rich and thick that it was famed through
the neighborhood as being able to stand by
itself, but, having retired to lavender and
camphor, was not expected forth any more
until the occasion of Mart Macauley’s infair
dinner.</p>

<p>Priscilla never looked so pretty as she did
on this Christmas night. She took no part
in the plays, but they sold pawns over her
head, and the penalties she inflicted were
considered brilliant.</p>

<p>“Heavy, heavy, what hangs over your
head!” said John Davis, the seller, holding
Miss Miller’s real gold ring. Her father
had tried that ring with aquafortis before
he allowed her to buy it of the peddler.</p>

<p>“Is it fine or superfine?” inquired Priscilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Superfine,” said John, pulling his neckerchief
with an air. “What must be done
to redeem it?”</p>

<p>“Let the owner make a charade.”</p>

<p>This sent Miss Miller, with assistants,
giggling into the pantry. And a grand
charade they exhibited, for Miss Miller had
picked up such things among the Lancaster
young people, and was not sorry to show
her knowledge. First the actors came in
supporting each other and weeping aloud.
In their second act there were several dumb
weddings, and in their third the weddings
were repeated with a change of partners.
After long guessing, everybody was struck
with admiration to discover that the word
was Bal-ti-more.</p>

<p>Then John sold Martin’s big handkerchief
over Priscilla’s head, informing her it
was fine only. And the possessor was bid
to bow to the wittiest, kneel to the prettiest,
and kiss the one he loved best, which Martin
did, perambulating about the room in a
long search, but coming back to Priscilla in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
every instance, covering her with confusion,
and exciting the company to hilarity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Macauley having discreetly retired,
they played “London Bridge is swept
away,” furnishing the music with their own
voices. The figures and changes made it very
similar to the “Virginia Reel,” and Mrs.
Macauley would have thought it sounded
like a dance had she not known “London
Bridge,” to be an innocent marching play.</p>

<p>Supper was served at ten o’clock, with
plates and white-handled knives and forks
held upon the knee, this variety of refreshment
being called a lap supper. The Macauley
genius for cookery shone resplendent.
Such cold meats and pickles and spiced
breads, such coffee (made at a neighboring
house in a wash-boiler, by Mrs. Macauley,
just before she retired), such varieties of
cake and pie, such metheglin and root beer,
flowed upon the guests as only Macauleys
knew how to make and brew.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to be havin’ as good a
time as the rest,” observed Philip Welchammer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to Theophilus Gill, when the plates were
being collected, and his plate retained a pile
of scarcely touched dainties.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m gittin’ along, I’m gittin’ along,”
said Theophilus.</p>

<p>“You ’pear kind o’ sober.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’twas a scare,” apologized Theophilus.</p>

<p>“But that’s all over now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all over,” assented the black-bearded
lover, with a sigh. And plucking
up animation, he added, “Mart has kind o’
took the bit in his teeth, hain’t he?”</p>

<p>“He has that. It’s a match now, if
Persilla’s a mind to have him. The old
lady, she’s turned round and set herself that
way too. I shouldn’t be surprised if the’s
an infair to this house by next Chris’mas.”</p>

<p>“No, neither would I,” said Theophilus,
shaking his head, and making a grimace as
if the action hurt him. He had a stirring,
money-making disposition, while Mart Macauley’s
tastes were those of a student, and
he thought himself as good a match. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
there was no accounting for the tricks of
fate.</p>

<p>Philip laughed in a heartening and sympathetic
fashion.</p>

<p>“I reckon the’ won’t be no chance for you
next Sunday night, nor any other Sunday
night this year, now,” he said.</p>

<p>“Mebby not,” said Theophilus. “But if
Mart Macauley gits her, he gits the Queen
of the Swamp, sure as you’re born. She’ll
always be that, come what will.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE STIRRING-OFF</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1850</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Davis’s</span> boys said to all the young men at
singing-school, “Come over to’r sugar-camp
Saturday night; we’re goin’ to stir off.”</p>

<p>The young men, sitting on the fence to
which horses were tied in dusky rows, playfully
imitated the preacher when he gave
out appointments, and replied they would be
there, no preventing Providence, at early
candle-lighting.</p>

<p>Jane Davis, attended by her cousin, also
circulated among the girls in the school-house
during that interval in singing-school
called recess, and invited them to the stirring-off.</p>

<p>The Davises, though by no means the richest,
were the most hospitable family in the
Swamp. They came from Virginia. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
stable swarmed with fine horses, each son
and daughter owning a colt; and the steeds
of visiting neighbors often crowded the stalls
until these looked like a horse-fair.</p>

<p>The Davises entertained every day in the
year. Their house was unpretending even
for those times, being of unpainted wood,
with a bedroom at each side of the porch, a
sitting-room where guns and powder-horns
hung over the fireplace, a kitchen, and a
loft. Yet here sojourned relations from
other counties, and even from over the mountains.
Here on Christmas and New Year’s
days were made great turkey-roasts. Out
of it issued Jane Davis to the dances and
parties where she was a belle, and her brothers,
ruddy, huge-limbed, black-eyed, and
dignified as any young men in Fairfield
County.</p>

<p>They kept bees, and raised what were
called noble turnips. Their farm appeared
to produce solely for the use of guests. In
watermelon season they kept what might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
termed open field. Their cookery was celebrated,
and their cordiality as free as sunshine.
No unwelcome guest could alight at
Davis’s. The head of the family, Uncle
Davis was a “general,” and this title carried
as much social weight as that of judge.
About their premises hung an atmosphere
of unending good times. On Sunday afternoons
late in November all the raw young
men of the neighborhood drew in a circle to
Davis’s fireplace, scraping turnips or apples.
Now the steel knives moved in concert, and
now they jarred; the hollow wall of a turnip
protested against the scrape, and Aunt
Davis passed the heaping pan again. Or
cracked walnuts and hickory nuts were the
offerings. Then every youth sat with an
overflowing handkerchief on his lap, and the
small blade of his knife busy with the kernels,—backlog
and forestick being bombarded
with shells which burned in blue and
crimson.</p>

<p>So when the Davises were ready to stir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
off in their sugar-camp, it was the most
natural thing in the world for them to invite
their neighbors to come and eat the
sugar, and for their neighbors to come and
do so.</p>

<p>The camp threw its shine far among leafless
trees. Three or four iron kettles
steamed on a pole over the fire. In a bark
lodge near by, Aunt Davis had put a lunch
of pies and cakes before she went home, to
be handed around at the stirring-off. It
was a clear starry night, the withered sod
crisp underfoot with the stiffness of ice.
Any group approaching silently could hear
the tapped maples dripping a liquid nocturne
into trough or pan.</p>

<p>But scarcely any groups approached
silently. They were heard chatting in the
open places, and their calls raised echoes.</p>

<p>John and Eck Davis had collected logs
and chunks and spread robes and blankets
until the seating capacity of the camp was
nearly equal to that of George’s Chapel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Some of the girls took off their wraps and
hung them in the bark house. One couple
carried away a bucket for more sugar-water
to cool a kettle, and other couples sauntered
after them. There were races on the spongy
dead leaves, and sudden squalls of remonstrance.</p>

<p>Jane Davis stood in the midst of her company,
moving a long wooden stirrer in the kettle
about to sugar-off. Though her beauty
was neither brown nor white, nor, in fact,
positive beauty of any kind, it cajoled everybody.
Her hair was folded close to her
cheeks. There was innocent audacity in the
curving line of every motion she made.
The young men were so taken by the spell
of her grace that she was accused of being
unrighteously engaged to three at once, and
about to add her cousin Tom Randall to the
list.</p>

<p>Tom Randall was a Virginian, spending
the winter in Ohio. He was handsome,
merry as Mercutio, and so easy in his manners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that the Swamp youths watched him
with varying emotions. He brought his
songs over the mountains: one celebrated
the swiftness of the electric telegraph in
flashing news from Baltimore to Wheeling;
another was about a Quaker courtship, and
set all the Swamp girls to rattling the lady’s
brisk response,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“What care I for your rings or money,—</div>
<div class="verse">Faddle-a-ding, a-ding, a-day;</div>
<div class="verse">I want a man that will call me honey,—</div>
<div class="verse">Faddle-a-ding, a-ding, a-day!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Tom Randall sat close to the fire, hanging
his delicate hands, which had never done a
day’s chopping, over his knees. He looked
much of a gentleman, Nora Waddell remarked
aside to Philip Welchammer. To
all the girls he was a central figure, as Jane
was a central figure to the young men.</p>

<p>But Philip claimed that Virginians were
no nearer perfection than out-and-out Swamp
fellows.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he was a perfect gentleman,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
said Nora, with cautious moderation,
“for I wouldn’t say so of any man.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t proud,” admitted Philip.
“He’s free to talk with everybody.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” remarked Mary Thompson,
sitting at the other side of Philip; “he
ought to be. Folks in Georger Chapel
neighborhood is just as good as anybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, I know he ain’t a prettier
dancer than Jane,” sighed Nora, whose
folks would not allow her to indulge in the
godless motion which the music of a fiddle
inspires. While Jane stirred and chatted,
she was swaying and taking dance-steps, as
if unable to refrain from spinning away
through the trees. In this great woods
drawing-room, where so many were gathered,
it was impossible for her to hear any comment
that went on.</p>

<p>“Jane makes a good appearance on the
floor,” responded Philip, who, being male,
could withstand the general denunciations
of the preacher and his mother’s praying at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
him in meeting. “I like to lead her out to
dance.”</p>

<p>“Uncle and Aunt Davis are just as easy
with Jane as if they wasn’t perfessors of
religion,” sighed Nora Waddell.</p>

<p>“And their boys thinks so much of her,”
added Mary Thompson. “John can’t go
anywhere unless she ties his neck-han’ketcher
for him. I’ve knowed him, when Jane
was sick, to come and lean over her to get
it fixed.”</p>

<p>“If she’s to leave them,” said Philip, “I
wonder how they’d do without her?”</p>

<p>“She’s goin’ to marry Cousin Jimmy
Thompson, that I know,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“She’s engaged to Dr. Miller in Lancaster,”
insisted Nora. “I’ve saw voluntines
he’s sent her.”</p>

<p>“Dick Hanks thinks he’s goin’ to get
her,” laughed Philip. “He told me she’s
as good as promised him. And Dick’s a
good feller, if he wasn’t such a coward.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Jane wants anybody,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
said Nora Waddell. “She’s light-minded,
and likes to enjoy herself.”</p>

<p>Dick Hanks stood by Jane and insisted
on helping her to move the stirrer. His
hair inclosed his head in the shape of a
thatch, leaving but narrow eaves of forehead
above his eyebrows, though his expression
was open and amiable. He looked like one
of Bewick’s cuts of an English carter. The
Hankses, however, were a rich family, and,
in spite of their eccentricities, a power in the
county. Old Jimmy Hanks so dreaded the
grave that he had a marble vault hewed,
watching its progress for years, and getting
himself ready to occupy it a few weeks
after its completion. Lest he should be
buried alive, his will decreed that the vault
should be unlocked and the coffin examined
at intervals. The sight of a face floating in
alcohol and spotted with drops from the
metal casket not proving grateful to his
heirs, the key was soon conveniently lost.</p>

<p>His son Dick, hearty in love and friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and noble in brawn, so feared the dark
that he would not go into an unlighted
room. When left by himself at the parting
of roads after a night’s frolic, he galloped
his horse through brush and mire, and it
was told that he had more than once reached
home without a whole stitch to his back.</p>

<p>But in spite of the powers of darkness,
Dick was anxious to take Jane Davis under
his protection. The fire and the noisy company
kept him from lifting his eyes to the
treetops swaying slowly overhead, and the
lonesome stars. All through the woods winter-night
sounds and sudden twig cracklings
could be heard. Dick, however, meant to
take Jane Davis home, whether he could
persuade one of the Davis boys to go home
with him afterward or not.</p>

<p>In those days neighborhoods were intensely
local. The people knew what historians
have not yet learned about the value of
isolated bits of human life. These young
folks in the sugar-camp knew nothing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the events and complications of the great
world, but they all felt more or less interested
in the politics of Jane Davis’s entanglements.</p>

<p>Her brother kept dipping a long spoon
into the kettle she stirred, and dropping the
liquid into a tin cup of cold sugar-water.
As long as the hot stuff twined about in
ropy arms, it was syrup; but as soon as it
settled to the bottom in a clear mass, it was
wax, and the change from wax to the grain
of sugar is a sudden one.</p>

<p>When Eck Davis announced, “It’s
waxed,” the kettle was slung off in haste,
and everybody left the tree which had
propped his back, or the robe on which he
had leaned, and the graining sugar was
served in saucers and handed around. It
could be eaten with spoons or “worked”
into crackling ropes. Davis’s boys took off
the syrup kettles and covered them up in
the bark lodge. They would be emptied
into stone jars when the more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
business of entertaining company was over.
The fire now shone redder. Jane was cutting
up pies and cakes in the bark house,
all this warm light focused on her lowered
eyelids, when more of her suitors arrived.</p>

<p>“I knowed the entire posse would be
out,” said Philip Welchammer in a laughing
undertone to the girls sitting beside him.
“Davises never misses invitin’ anybody.”</p>

<p>“You’re too late, Jimmy Thompson,”
called Jane’s elder brother before he noticed
the preacher was in the party. “Your
sheer’s e’t.” When, however, Dr. Miller
from Lancaster also came forward, John
stood up stiffly and put on his company
grandeur. He held the town-man in some
awe, and was bound to be constrained by
the preacher.</p>

<p>Jimmy Thompson, having met Jane with
awkward heartiness, said he would make the
young folks acquainted with Brother Gurley.
They all knew Brother Gurley; but Jimmy
was a wild young man, and his audacity in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
“brother”-ing the preacher was more delicious
than home-made sugar. He afterward
explained that the preacher had been turned
onto the old folks for Sunday, and he asked
him along to the frolic without suspicionin’
he’d come, but the preacher, he took a-holt
as if that was the understandin’.</p>

<p>Jane met Brother Gurley and Dr. Miller
with equal ease. A hush fell upon the company,
and they ate and watched her serve
the newcomers and appear to balance such
formidable individuals in her hands. Affectation
was in that region the deadliest sin a
girl could commit against her own popularity,
and Jane’s manner was always beautifully
simple.</p>

<p>The preacher had a clean-shaven, large
face, huge blue eyes, and laughing white
teeth, and a sprinkling of fine, indefinitely
tinted hair. His figure was vigorous, and
well made to bear the hardships of a Methodist
circuit-rider. His presence had the
grasp of good-fellowship and power, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
rather dwarfed Dr. Miller, whom all the
girls thought a very pretty man. Dr. Miller
wore side-whiskers, and a Lancaster suit of
clothes finished by a fine round cloak hooked
under his chin. When he took off his hat
to bow, two curls fell over his forehead.
The woman who would not take Dr. Miller
if he wanted her must expect to have the
pick of creation, and maybe she would miss
it after all. He talked to Jane and ate
maple sugar with the greatest of Lancaster
ease, telling her he had put up with his cousin
in Millersport and borrowed a horse to
ride to camp. John Davis at once said the
folks at home expected him to put up with
them over Sunday, and the other young
men resented the doctor’s prompt acceptance
of Davis’s hospitality.</p>

<p>The preacher, holding his saucer of sugar
in his left hand, was going around and giving
the right hand of fellowship to every
young person in camp. This was the proper
and customary thing for him to do. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
preacher who went into company anywhere
on the circuit without shaking hands and
pushing and strengthening his acquaintance
would be a worse stumbling-block than a
backslider given up to superfluous clothing
and all kinds of sinful levity, or a new
convert with artificials in her bonnet. But
there was a tingling quality in Brother
Gurley’s grasp which stirred the blood;
and his heavy voice was as prevailing in its
ordinary tones as in the thunders of the
pulpit.</p>

<p>“Did you bring your wife with you, Brother
Gurley?” simpered Tabitha Gill, a
dwarfish, dark old maid, devout in church
and esteemed for her ability to make a good
prayer.</p>

<p>Mary Thompson whispered behind her
back, “Tabitha Gill’s always for findin’ out
whether a preacher’s married or not before
anybody else does.”</p>

<p>“Not this time,” replied Brother Gurley,
warming Sister Gill’s heart with a broad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
class-meeting smile. “But I expect to bring
her with me when I come around again.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said Tabitha; “and stop at our
house.”</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to you, Sister Gill,” replied
the preacher. “You have a fine community
of young people here.”</p>

<p>“But they ain’t none of ’em converted.
There’s a good deal of levity in Georger
Chapel neighborhood. Now, Jane, now,—Jane
Davis,—she’s a girl nobody can help
likin’, but many’s the night that she’s
danced away in sinful amusement. I wish
you’d do somethin’ for her soul, Brother
Gurley.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” responded the preacher heartily.
He looked with a tender and indulgent
eye at Jane, who was dividing her company
into two parts, to play one innocent play
before the camp broke up.</p>

<p>“Come away from here,” whispered Philip
Welchammer to the girl beside him, seceding
from the preacher’s group and adding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
himself to Jane’s. “Tabitha Gill will be
haulin’ us all up to the mourners’ bench
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>They played “clap-out,” the girls sitting
in their wraps all ready to depart, and the
young men turning up their collars and tying
on their comforters while waiting a summons.
Jane was leader, and with much tittering
and secrecy each young lady imparted
to Jane the name of the youth she wished to
have sit beside her. Dick Hanks was called
first, and he stood looking at the array from
which he could take but one choice, his lips
dropping apart and his expression like that
he used to display under the dunce-cap at
Gum College. During this interval of silence
the drip of sugar-water into troughs
played a musical phrase or two, and the
stirring and whinnying of the horses could
be heard where they were tied to saplings.
No rural Ohioan ever walked a quarter of a
mile if he had any kind of beast or conveyance
to carry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>Then Dick of course sat down by the
wrong girl, and was clapped out, and Dr.
Miller was called. Dr. Miller made a pleasing
impression by hesitating all along the
line, and when he sat down by Mary
Thompson her murmur of assent was a tribute
to his sagacity. Cousin Tom Randall
was summoned, and sung two or three lines
of the “Quaker’s Courtship” before throwing
himself on the mercy of Nora Waddell.
He was clapped out, and said he always expected
it. West of the Alleghanies was no
place for him; they were even goin’ to clap
him out up at uncle’s. Then the preacher
came smiling joyfully, and placed himself by
Tabitha Gill, where he was tittered over and
allowed to remain; and one by one the seats
were filled, the less fortunate men making
a second trial with more success when their
range was narrowed.</p>

<p>Everybody rose up to go home. But a
great many “good-nights,” and reproaches
for social neglect, and promises of future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
devotion to each other, had first to be exchanged.
Then Jimmy Thompson, who had
driven in his buggy expressly to take Jane
Davis home, and was wondering what he
should do with the preacher, saw with astonishment
that Brother Gurley had Jane upon
his own arm and was tucking her shawl close
to her chin. Her black eyes sparkled
within a scarlet hood. She turned about
with Brother Gurley, facing all the young
associates of her life, and said, “We want
you all to come to our house after preachin’
to-morrow. The presidin’ elder will be
there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care nothin’ about the presidin’
elder,” muttered Jimmy Thompson.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to be a weddin’, you know,” explained
John Davis, turning from assisting
his brother Eck to empty the syrup kettles,
and beaming warmly over such a general
occasion. “The folks at meeting will all
be invited, but Jane said she wanted to ask
the young people separate to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“And next time I come around the circuit,”
said Brother Gurley, gathering Jane’s
hand in his before the company, “I’ll bring
my wife with me.”</p>

<p>They walked away from the campfire,
Jane turning her head once or twice to call
“Good-night, all,” as if she still clung to
every companionable hand. The party
watched her an instant in silence. Perhaps
some were fanciful enough to see her walking
away from the high estate of a doctor’s
wife in Lancaster, from the Hanks money,
and Jimmy Thompson’s thrift, into the constant
change and unfailing hardships of
Methodist itinerancy. The dancing motion
would disappear from her gait, and she who
had tittered irreverently at her good mother’s
labors with backsliders at the mourners’
bench would come to feel an interest in such
sinners herself.</p>

<p>“Dog’d if I thought Jane Davis would
ever marry a preacher!” burst out Jimmy
Thompson, in sudden and hot disapproval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Don’t it beat all!” murmured Tabitha
Gill. “And her an unconverted woman in
the error of her ways! Jane’s too young
for a preacher’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Jane’s fooled us all,” owned Philip
Welchammer heartily. To keep intended
nuptials a family secret until a day or a few
hours before the appointed time was as much
a custom of the country as was prying into
and spying out such affairs. Surprising her
friends by her wedding was, therefore, adding
to Jane’s social successes; but only Dr.
Miller could perceive her true reason for
assembling her suitors at the last moment.
While discarding them all, her hospitable
nature clung to their friendship; she wished
to tell them in a group the change she contemplated,
so that no one could accuse her
of superior kindness to another. Her very
cruelties were intended mercies.</p>

<p>“That’s the way the pretty girls go,”
sighed Cousin Tom Randall, seizing hold of
Jane’s younger brother: “the preachers get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
’em. Come on, Eck; I have to be helped
home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see when he courted her,”
breathed Dick Hanks, closing his lips after
many efforts.</p>

<p>“Preachers is chain-lightnin’,” laughed
Jimmy Thompson. “He’s been around
often enough, and always stoppin’ there.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow after preachin’,” said John
impressively, as he came forward after hastily
covering the jars. “We’re goin’ to
have a turkey-dinner, and we want you all to
be sure to come. And next time Brother
Gurley and Jane makes the circuit, we’ll
have the infair at our house, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like Davises,” exclaimed one
of the dispersing group in the midst of their
eager promises; “they wouldn’t be satisfied
unless they give the weddin’ and the infair
both, and invited all quarterly meetin’ to set
down to the table. I thought there was
doin’s over at their house; but then they’re
always bakin’ and fussin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>They could all picture a turkey-roast at
Davis’s: the crisp, brown turkeys rising
from their own dripping, squares of pone as
yellow as buttercups, and biscuits calculated
to melt whitely with honey from glass dishes
of sweet-smelling combs. There would be
every kind of vegetable grown in the Swamp,
and game from the banks of the Feeder and
Reservoir, pies and cakes and coffee, and at
least eight kinds of preserves. Jane Davis
and the preacher would stand up in front of
the fireplace, and after the ceremony there
would be a constant rattle of jokes from the
presiding elder and his assistants. And
over the whole house would hang that happy
atmosphere which makes one think of corn
ripening on a sunny hillside in still September
weather. A dozen times the long tables
would be replenished and supplied with
plates, all the usual features of a turkey-roast
at Davis’s being exaggerated by the
importance of the occasion; and Aunt Davis
would now and then forget to urge a guest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
while she hurriedly wiped her eyes and
replied to some expression of neighborly
sympathy, that they had to lose Jane sometime,
and it was a good thing for a girl to
get a religious man. Then about dusk the
preachers and their congregation would start
again to chapel, and Jane, in Millersport
clothes, would shine on the front seats as a
bride, certain of an ovation when the after-meeting
handshaking came. It would be a
spite if she sat where tallow candles could
drip on her from one of the wooden chandeliers,
but she would enjoy hearing her
bridegroom exhort, and he would feel like
exhorting with all his might.</p>

<p>“Well, Doc,” said John Davis, turning
from the deserted camp and sinking fire to
place himself by the bridle of the young
man from Lancaster.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dr. Miller, “I’m obliged
to you, John; but I’ll ride back to Millersport
to-night.”</p>

<p>“You don’t feel put out?” urged John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
conscious of a pang because all the good
fellows who courted Jane could not become
his brothers-in-law.</p>

<p>“No; oh, no,” protested Dr. Miller with
chagrin. “She’d a right to suit herself.
I’ll be around some other day.”</p>

<p>“We’d take it hard if you didn’t,” said
John.</p>

<p>“But just now,” concluded the doctor,
“I feel what a body might call—stirred-off.”</p>

<p>Dick Hanks was riding up close to Jimmy
Thompson, while Jimmy unblanketed his
mare and prepared for a deliberate departure.</p>

<p>“John, now,” remarked Jimmy,—“he
brothered the preacher right up, didn’t he?
They’ll be makin’ a class-leader o’ John yet,
if they can git him to quit racin’ horses.”</p>

<p>“Which way you goin’ home, Jimmy?”
inquired Dick Hanks anxiously.</p>

<p>“The long way, round by Georger Chapel,
where I can look at the tombstones for company.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Want to go along? We can talk
over the weddin’, and you’re only two mile
from home at our woods’ gate.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll take the short cut through
the brush,” said Dick.</p>

<p>Jimmy drove through the clearing and
fence-gap, where John Davis was waiting to
lay up the rails again.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said John, and they
both paused to listen.</p>

<p>It was a sound of crashing and scampering,
of smothered exclamation and the rasping
and tearing of garments. Dick Hanks
was whipping his steed through the woods,
against trees, logs, and branches, as if
George’s Chapel graveyard, containing the
ghastly vault of his father, and George’s
Chapel preacher, waving Jane Davis in one
victorious hand, were both in merciless pursuit
of him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SWEETNESS</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1855</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Amber</span> light in the dense Ohio woods receded
slowly from the path which a woman
ascended. The earth was frozen, and glazed
puddles stood in cow tracks. But this woman
loved to climb from the valley farms
and her day’s sewing, of chill December
evenings, and feel that she approached her
heaven and left the world behind. The year
had just passed its shortest day. Neighborhood
custom allowed her to leave her tasks
early in the evening, because she came to
them with a lantern in the morning. She
hastened as you may have noticed a large-eyed
anxious cow cantering toward its nursling;
but stopped to breathe, half ashamed
of herself, in sight of a log-house known
through the Rocky Fork settlement as
Coon’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>All the Coons had been queer little people,
but this last daughter of them exceeded
her forefathers in squatty squareness of stature
and Japanese cast of feature. As she
was quite thirty-five her friends called her
an old maid, according to the custom of that
remote period. Yet there was not a girl on
all the windings of the Rocky Fork who had
more laughter in her eyes, or smoother
cheeks, or darker polished hair.</p>

<p>“Sure’s my name is Wilda Coon,” said
the small woman beneath her breath, “yonder
comes Lanson Bundle.”</p>

<p>The man she saw was yet far off, plodding
across the valley toward her hillside; and as
he had taken that walk nearly every evening
for a dozen years, it should have ceased to
surprise her. Yet as shadows thickened
among rock and naked trees, it was always
a satisfaction to turn and look back from
that particular point and exclaim, “Yonder
comes Lanson Bundle!”</p>

<p>Wilda’s log-house had a clearing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
some acres of trees around it, standing like
a German principality or an oasis in the
midst of Alanson Bundle’s great farm. The
Bundles had vainly tried in times past to
buy out the Coons. But Alanson had other
views. He had courted Wilda twelve years,
and he calculated in time to wear her out.
She could not go on forever raising patches
of truck in the summer, and quilting and
sewing in the winter.</p>

<p>Alanson was not uncomfortable while he
waited. His aunt kept house for him at his
homestead, where he had several barns, a
milk-house, a smoke-house and all modern
conveniences around him. He felt his value
with everybody but Wilda. The youngest
girls showed him no discouragement. There
was a sonorous pomp about his singing in
meeting which affected every rural nature,
while his Adam’s apple, like a sensitive
lump of mercury, trembled up and down its
inclosure. Some folks thought Alanson
Bundle ought to have been a preacher. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
would look so nice standing in a pulpit, with
his hair sleeked up in a straight roach, saying,
“Hence we discover, my brethren.”
But Wilda Coon never had made any fuss
over him. And for that reason he followed
her with abject service.</p>

<p>In that early year of the fifties a great
many people about the Rocky Fork had
locks on their doors. But a tow latch-string
hung out for Wilda Coon, and with it she
lifted the wooden latch of her dwelling. At
night, for security, she would draw the string
inside, and slip a wooden bar into staples
across the thick board portal.</p>

<p>The tight-chinked cabin had the strangest
interior on the Rocky Fork. There was
only one room, and the hollow of the roof
rose up in a cavernous arch without joists.
Two wooden bars were, indeed, set high
across one corner, but they served as roosts
for chickens who had already taken to them
for the night, and who stirred quavering as
Wilda shut the door and emptied a gourd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Before the fire, yet not too near it, was a
trundle-bed which could be pushed anywhere
on wheels.</p>

<p>She dropped her hood and shawl upon a
chair and slipped toward the trundle-bed,
motioning back a great mastiff who kept
guard at the hearth. He sat down again
and licked his lips; the glory of burning
logs in the fireplace was enough to content
any dog, for that cabin seemed to have the
sunset imprisoned within it. Calico curtains
on the four-paned windows hid darkening
woods outside.</p>

<p>“O Sweetness!” whispered Wilda, bending
over the trundle-bed and scarcely daring
to touch the patchwork quilt. Her eyes
were full of kisses and fondling for her only
baby, the helpless being who reversed for
her the maternal relations. It was a little
old woman, whose apple face had shriveled
into puckers only around the corners of the
eyes and mouth. A dimity nightcap tied it
in, almost covering white silk threads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
hair. This helpless mother, lying in the
dead alive state we now call paralysis, and
the Rocky Forkers then called palsy, was
the secret delight of Wilda’s heart, and
Alanson Bundle’s only rival. But she concealed
her fondness like a crime. The name
of Sweetness was sacred to that hollow
cabin. Bounce could make no remark about
it, and he was the only safe auditor in an
age when excess of loving was considered
weakness.</p>

<p>Wilda hung her supper kettles on the
hooks of the crane, and made biscuits, and
raked out coals to bake them in a Dutch
oven. Alanson Bundle would not appear
until the evening meal was over. He pottered
around in his woods or went across
the ridge to look after cattle.</p>

<p>The log-house was exquisite with cleanness,
even in that corner where the fowls
roosted. No cobwebs or dust marred the
rich brown of its upper depth. The floor
and stone hearth were scoured white. Wilda’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
spinning-wheel stood beside one wall.
Her own apartment was an oblong space
curtained with homespun which had been
dyed a dull red. Some red and gilt chairs,
a pine table and a red and gilt cushioned
settee on rockers, furnished the house. The
log wall between hearth and door held gay
trappings of tinware and pewter, all shining
in the mighty blaze.</p>

<p>The table was spread and a perfume of
coffee filled the place. Wilda had turned
the fried eggs and lifted them carefully to a
platter before she heard the usual sounds
her mother made to call her.</p>

<p>Sweetness was wide awake and smiling
like a baby. The Rocky Fork people said
she had her faculties but couldn’t make no
use of them. Unabated intelligence looked
through her eyes and her face never distorted
itself, although she could not talk.</p>

<p>“Have you been lonesome to-day, Sweetness?
No? Have you slept much? Yes?
That’s good. Did Speckle and Banty sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
on Bounce’s back and keep you company?
They’ve gone to roost now. They’re going
to wake up about midnight and crow for
Christmas, and wake you up—the bad
chickens.—Now supper’s ready. Folks
round here thinks I starve you because you
never eat in the middle of the day. ’Tain’t
no use for me to say anything. But if you
don’t want me to be clean disgraced, you
must eat hearty when you do eat.”</p>

<p>She fed the helpless being with long and
patient use of a spoon. The fire roared.
Bounce rose up and yawned, stretching his
limbs, to hint that his own plate had been
empty since morning. But Wilda never
hurried this important part of her day’s
business. The food which she must eat became
overdone. She sat on the trundle-bed,
giving her mother with the spoon meat all
the life and doings of that small world on
the Rocky Fork.</p>

<p>“Gutteridges were going to have a turkey-roast
to-morrow. The presiding elder was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
at their house. Yes, their sewing was done;
she finished Mandy’s black quilted petticoat
to-day. Mandy and ’Lizabeth both had new
shawls that their father had paid six dollars
apiece for, at the woolen factory in Newark;
stripes and crossbars. Ridenour’s little boy
was so he could sit up; the doctor thought
the fever was broke. The Bankses were all
going to take dinner at granny’s. And some
folks said one of Harris’s girls was to be
married to-morrow, but it might be all talk.
There wasn’t much chance of snow, but it
was a cold night outside. Didn’t Sweetness
hear the wind across the roof? It was a
good thing our clapboards were on so tight.”</p>

<p>So this one-sided conversation went on
until the little old woman was quite filled.
Then Wilda made her snug, as if attending
an infant, and fed Bounce, and sat down
alone at the table.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the clean pewter and crockery
in place again, and the wheel set out
where the table had been, and Wilda bundled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
ready to go out, when a knock sounded
on the door.</p>

<p>She opened it, and exclaimed as she always
did,—</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! here’s Lanson. Come
in, Lanson, and take a chair.”</p>

<p>“Gimme your milk bucket,” responded
Alanson.</p>

<p>“I was just starting to milk, Lanson.
Don’t you bother yourself with it to-night.”</p>

<p>But he took her pail. And Wilda, smiling,
laid off her wraps and made the hearth
very clean, and plumped up the settee cushions.</p>

<p>When Alanson handed the frothing pail
into the door, without putting foot over the
threshold, he glanced at the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Want another log brought in to-night?”</p>

<p>“Law, Lanson! that one ain’t half burnt.”</p>

<p>“But it’ll settle down before another
twenty-four hours. I ’low I’d better fetch
a few sticks.”</p>

<p>So he came in laden with sections of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
trees, and built them handily upon the
structure of the fire.</p>

<p>“Do you want ary bucket of water?”
was his next inquiry.</p>

<p>“No, I’m obleeged to you, Lanson,” replied
Wilda. “I fetched a big gourdful
from the spring as I come uphill. It saves
steps.”</p>

<p>Alanson now unbelted and took off his
butternut-colored wamus, and Wilda hung
it with his hat on a peg. He had a fine
black blanket shawl for meeting, but he was
not so reckless as to scratch it through hill
underbrush every evening.</p>

<p>Feeling himself now ready for society,
Alanson walked over to the trundle-bed and
greeted the invalid.</p>

<p>“Good even’, Mis’ Coon; it’s right wintry
outdoors.”</p>

<p>She gave him an approving smile. He
sat down in the settee and rocked himself,
while Wilda pulled a long thread from her
spindle, stepped back and gave the wheel a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
whirl. The trundle-bed, as usual, stood between
her and her besieger. A hum, rising
and rising like some sweet tune through the
pines, filled the room. The great wheel
blurred all its spokes, and found them again,
and slackened to a slow revolution, as Wilda
came back to the spindle.</p>

<p>“How’s your aunt to-day?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Middling,” replied Alanson. Again the
music of the spinning arose. Alanson
warmed his feet and hands, and felt comforted
after his tramp through the vast chill
woods.</p>

<p>When the silent companionship which he
enjoyed with Wilda had quite filled its measure,
he took from his pocket and unfolded
a large newspaper.</p>

<p>“I’ll light a candle,” said Wilda, with
that eagerness for romance which the simplest
lives manifest.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t needed,” said Alanson. What
was a candle’s star to that blazing sun in
the fireplace? He turned his shoulder so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the light fell upon the “Saturday Evening
Post,” and read a harrowing installment
about some Bride of the Wilderness. There
was domestic bliss in this snug cabin, the
wind-song of the wheel, and the winter night
with its breath of Christmas. Alanson
droned on in a high key, the mother watching
him as long as she was able to resist so
many monotones. She went to sleep before
Wilda’s stint of spinning was done, and before
Alanson read with impressive voice,
“To be con-tin-u-ed.”</p>

<p>That wary inspection of each other which
people of that time called courting had
varied its routine so little for twelve years
betwixt this pair, that Alanson felt bound
to make his usual remark as Wilda sat
down to knit.</p>

<p>“Well, folks is still talking about us getting
married, Wilda.”</p>

<p>“Let them talk,” said Wilda, putting her
hair behind her ear, and smiling while she
looked at Sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“I come here pretty regular. Don’t you
think it’s about time we set the day?”</p>

<p>Wilda answered, without moving her eyes
from the trundle-bed, “Don’t you think we
better let well enough alone, Lanson?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, ’tisn’t well enough,” argued
Alanson, and to the sylvan mind there is
accumulated force in an oft-used argument.
“You’ve got these woods lots and the house
and a cow”—</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m well fixed,” murmured Wilda.</p>

<p>—“but you have to leave your mother
and go out among the neighbors to airn a
living. How do you know sometime the
house won’t burn down?”</p>

<p>“I am jub’ous about it often,” owned
Wilda, biting the end of a knitting-needle.
But catching the yarn over her little finger
she drove it ahead with her work.</p>

<p>“Then eventually she might die.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that,” sighed Wilda.
“And I’ve thought what’d become of her
if I’s to be taken and her left. Then who’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
let her pet rooster and hen—that she’s
just as tickled with as a child—roost in
the house, and clean after them without
fretting her?”</p>

<p>Alanson glanced at Speckle and Banty
sticking like balls to their perch, and he
volunteered some discreet possibilities.</p>

<p>“When folks begins to get used to such
things before they’re too old and sot in
their ways, seems to me like chickens in the
house would be natteral enough—though
not brought up to it.”</p>

<p>Whenever Alanson made this great concession,
Wilda always fell back upon her
observations of marriage.</p>

<p>“But there’s Mary Jane Willey. She
had fifteen hundred dollars in her own right,
and was well fixed with bedding and goods—six
chairs and a bread-trough and a cupboard.
And all that didn’t satisfy her, but
she must have a man to speckalate with her
money and lose it; and now he’s took to
drinking, her and her children are like to go
on the county.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Alanson interlaced his fingers across his
chest and set his thumbs to whirling.</p>

<p>“She ought to got a man like me,” he
observed humorously.</p>

<p>Then the topic was usually diverted into
the lives of other Rocky Forkers until Alanson
felt it was time to go home.</p>

<p>But to-night, after drawing out his silver
watch by its steel log-chain, he lingered uneasily
instead of rising from the settee and
saying, “Well, I better be moseying towards
home.”</p>

<p>The flashing of Wilda’s needles went on.
She had a leather stall pinned to her waist,
in which she braced and steadied the most
rampant needle as he led the gallop around
the stocking. Sweetness slept as a spirit
may sleep who has escaped the bounds of
care, her sunken little mouth and wrinkled
eye-corners steadily smiling.</p>

<p>“Going to have any Christmas up here
to-morrow?” inquired Alanson, with a sheepish
look at Wilda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I got a Christmas gift for her,” replied
Wilda fondly. Alanson understood the pronouns
which always stood for mother.</p>

<p>“Well, now, it’s funny,” said he. “But
I got something for her, too.”</p>

<p>“Why, Lanson! What ever put you up
to do such a thing?” Wilda paused with
her needle held back in mid plunge.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t much,” apologized Alanson, and
he brought his wamus from the peg to the
hearth. Wilda had noticed it was laden
when she hung it up, but she always discreetly
overlooked the apples he brought
until he made his offering.</p>

<p>There were no apples in the wamus pockets
this time. Alanson took out two packets,
and opened one which he laid on Wilda’s
knee. It was a pound of red hearts.</p>

<p>“The other’s for her,” he said “and it’s
all white ones.”</p>

<p>“Why, Lanson Bundle!” exclaimed
Wilda.</p>

<p>But he had yet another paper, and it disclosed
the yellow coats of tropical fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“What’s them?” breathed Wilda, bending
over in admiration. “Why, Lanson
Bundle! If them ain’t lemons and oranges!
Where in this world did you get them?”</p>

<p>“I sent clean to Fredericktown for them,”
confessed the suitor with an apologetic grin.
“I thought her being bedfast so steady all
the time, she’d like something out of the
common.”</p>

<p>“You are <i>real</i> clever,” spoke Wilda with
trembling voice. “She’ll be so tickled!
I been making her two fine caps with hem-stitching
around the border;—but this does
beat all!”</p>

<p>“I done something else,” Alanson ventured
on, “that you’ll think is simple;—I’ve
never seen such a thing, but I’ve read
about it. Coming along through the pines I
took my jack-knife out and cut a little one
off close to the ground; and it’s laying outside
the door.”</p>

<p>“What for, Lanson?”</p>

<p>“A Christmas-tree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, in a foreign place they call Germany,
I’ve read they take an evergreen and
make it stand like it growed in the house,
and hang gifts on it, and if I don’t disremember,
they fix candles into it and light
them.”</p>

<p>“I should think that would be pretty,”
said Wilda in some excitement. “Law, Lanson!
If we could fix it at the foot of her
trundle-bed!”</p>

<p>Alanson thought they could fix it, and he
set vigorously about the task. He ran out
to the ash-hopper and brought in the keg
which in summer time caught the lye. The
evergreen tree, beautifully straight, and tasseled
at the top, he fastened in the keg
ingeniously, without clamor of nails and
pounding.</p>

<p>Then maid and bachelor trimmed the
Christmas-tree for their old sleeping child.
A dexterous use of string hung all the hearts
to the boughs, as well as oranges and lemons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
One cap was put on the top tassel, and the
other dropped from a branch by its ties.
Wilda brought out her candle box and recklessly
cut the moulded tallow into short tapers.
This part of the decoration greatly
taxed both Alanson and her. But they
finally pinned all the tapers in place, and
concluded to light the wicks for a trial.</p>

<p>Alanson carried a brand from point to
point. Wilda was frightened at the beauty
of the thing and their unusual occupation.
Her eyes and cheeks were vivid. She had
never been so wildly excited in her life before.
Thought and resolution, which had
battled for years, bounded forward with the
bounding of her blood.</p>

<p>“Lanson Bundle!” she laughed, “what
do you suppose folks would say if they
peeked in and seen us at this!”</p>

<p>“I ’low they’d want to have a Christmas-tree
themselves,” responded the bachelor.
“You and me will have one next year at
our own house, won’t we, Wilda?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“Well, I don’t know but we will. I
don’t know as I can hold out much longer.
You’re a real good man, Lanson, and if I’ve
got to get married, there ain’t nobody I’d
have as quick as you.”</p>

<p>At that admission Alanson laid the brand
on the fire, wiped his lips carefully with a
red cotton handkerchief, and came expectantly
round the Christmas-tree. But with
the recoil of a middle-aged girl from dropping
man a word of encouragement, Wilda
flew behind the trundle-bed and kept her
lover warned by an uplifted palm.</p>

<p>“I haven’t made up my mind to no kissing
yet, Lanson Bundle! I ain’t used to
kissing anybody but her.”</p>

<p>Alanson looked at the little mother in the
trundle-bed, and she opened her eyes, disturbed
by such scampering. The pet chickens
were roused also, and Speckle crowed on his
perch with a vigor which belongs only to the
midnight of Christmas eve.</p>

<p>“Look there, Sweetness,” Wilda whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
kneeling. “Do you see what Lanson’s
fixed for you? That’s a Christmas-tree.”</p>

<p>The mother’s eyes caught the Christmas-tree,
and snapped with astonishment and delight.
The tapers were dripping tallow, but
firelight shone through the boughs, and all
the wonderful hearts and yellow fruit hung
like a fairy picture. Her grateful look
finally sought Alanson, and he also knelt
down, at the opposite side of the trundle-bed,
and with reverence which brought a rush of
tears to Wilda’s eyes, kissed Sweetness on
the forehead.</p>

<p>Wilda furtively gathered her tears on her
finger-tips, and hid them in her linsey dress,
but she said impressively to Alanson,—</p>

<p>“Now, that kiss will make you a better
man all your life.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SERENA</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1860</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Serena Hedding</span> drove through the gateway
of her father’s farm, while her little son
held the creaking gate open. Her vehicle
was a low buggy, with room at the back for
a sack of nubbins, which the scrawny white
horse would appreciate on his return trip.
The driver was obliged to cluck encouragement
to him as he paused, with his head
down, in the gateway; and before he had
taken ten steps forward, before Milton could
stick the pin back in the post-hole and scamper
to his seat at her left side, she lived her
girlhood over. She saw her father holding
that gate open for camp-meeting or protracted-meeting
folks to drive in to dinner
with him. She saw Milton Hedding ride
through to court her, and the scowl her father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
gave him; and the buggy which waited
for her in the woods one afternoon, herself
getting into it, and Milton whipping up his
horse to carry her away forever.</p>

<p>The road wound, folding on itself, through
dense woods. Nothing had changed about
the road. She noticed that the old log
among the haw saplings remained untouched.
That log was a link binding her childhood
to her girlhood. She sat on it to baste up
the hem of her ridiculously long dress before
going to school, her dinner-basket waiting
near; and, coming home in the evening, she
there ripped the basting out, lest Aunt
Lindy should notice that her skirt did not
flop against her heels, as proper skirts had
done in Aunt Lindy’s childhood. Seated
on that log, she and Milton had talked of
the impossibility of their marriage, and decided
to run away.</p>

<p>It was so near sunset that the woods were
in mellow twilight. She heard the cows
lowing away off, and a loaded wagon rumbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
over the Feeder bridge. The loamy
incense of this ancestral land was so sweet
that it pained her. Soon the house would
come in sight, and seem to strike her on the
face. If they had altered it any, she did
not know it. Was her father’s sick-bed
downstairs, or did Aunt Lindy keep him
above the narrow staircase? The slippery-elm
tree she used to wound for its juicy
strips started out at the roadside to give her
a scarry welcome. Her fingers brushed her
cheeks, and drew the black sunbonnet farther
over them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mother?” inquired
her light-haired boy. “Are you feared
grandfather’s worse?”</p>

<p>“I hope he ain’t,” replied Serena. Then
the house, on its rising ground, appeared,
crossed by trees. It had a yard in which
lilac bushes and tall hollyhocks bordered
the path. The gate opened into an orchard,
and the orchard was guarded from the lane
by bars, which Serena’s little boy let down,
and they drove in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Her father’s barn was one of those immense
structures which early Ohio farmers
built to indicate their wealth. It had always
seemed bursting with hay and grain,
and the stamp of horses resounded from its
basement stables.</p>

<p>Serena looked piteously at the house. Vehicles
of various kinds were fastened all
along the fence. Still, no solemn voice or
sound of singing reached her ear. It had
long been the Jeffries custom to hold services
over their dead at the house. No feather-bed
hung across the garden palings;
neither was the hideous cooling-board standing
up anywhere, like a wooden tombstone.
But the whole neighborhood was there. He
must be very low indeed.</p>

<p>The youthful widow and her boy alighted,
and tied their horse in a humble corner near
the woodpile. Nobody came out to receive
them. That was another bad sign. She
was cramped by her long ride. If her suspense
had not been so great she must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
felt a pang of shame at the shabby appearance
of her son and herself, on this first
return from exile.</p>

<p>The house dog barked, waking suddenly
from his meditations to learn who they were
and what they wanted. But he recollected
that a great many strangers had been coming
and going recently, and considering his
duty done, trotted back, and stretched himself
to snap flies.</p>

<p>Serena felt obliged to go around to the
front of the house, though the back doorstep
showed the wear of her childish feet.
But as she passed the first rosebush, Milty
trotting in the white path behind her, a woman
came from the back porch, holding a
handkerchief over her cap, the ribbons of
which flew back on each side of her neck.
The light glared on her spectacles. She
was as trim and quick as a young girl.
Her dress, cape, and apron were of the same
material, and her waist was fastened in
front with a spiky row of pins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Serene Heddin’!” she exclaimed, with
the spring in her voice which Serena remembered
comparing to the clip of a mouse-trap,
“you’re not goin’ into the front door to
scare your father to death in his last moments.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Lindy,” said the shabby
widow, lifting her hands, “is he as bad as
that?”</p>

<p>“He’s been struck with death all the
afternoon. You come in this way.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I see him?” asked Mrs. Hedding,
climbing over the back doorstone like
a suddenly exhausted pilgrim, her face quivering
under streams of tears.</p>

<p>Through open doors she recognized in the
parlor and sitting-room groups of old neighbors,
waiting in that hush with which they
always accompanied one another to the brink
of death. A woman came from among
them, whispering,—</p>

<p>“Who’s this, Lindy?” and immediately
informing herself: “Why, Sereny Jeffr’s!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Have you got here? Come right in to your
pap. He’s pretty nigh gone.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do no good, Sister McGafferty,”
said Aunt Lindy. “He won’t know her,
and ’twill disturb him. She was postin’ in
at the front door when I caught her,” declared
Aunt Lindy, as if speaking of a thief.</p>

<p>Sister McGafferty, a comfortable, large
woman in blue spectacles, the presiding
elder’s wife, and therefore a person of authority,
still beckoned Serena in, and she
passed Aunt Lindy, followed by her barefooted
boy. The round-posted bedstead was
drawn out from the wall, and under its sheet
and many colored quilt lay the old farmer,
his mouth open, his eyes glazed, his narrow
brows and knotty features wearing a ghastly
pallor. But behind the solemn terror of
that face was her father.</p>

<p>Aunt Lindy followed, and twitched her
elbow, thereby creating a faction in Serena
Hedding’s favor among the spectators. They
were all well-to-do people, who noticed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
dejected attitude toward the world, and had
always disapproved of her thriftless match.
But they said within themselves that Lindy
Miller was going too far when she tried to
pull a daughter away from her dying father.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you ’shamed to disturb his last
peaceful minutes!” Aunt Lindy hissed with
force.</p>

<p>But the returned culprit fastened such
desperate interest on the unseeing eyes of
her father that Aunt Lindy’s interruption
was as remote to her as the gambols of loose
horses in the pasture.</p>

<p>If there had now been time and opportunity,
Serena could not argue her case with
him. He never had allowed that. She
could not tell how true and happy her marriage
was, in spite of his disapproval and its
accompanying poverty. She had suffered,
but her heart had ripened so that she could
discern and love the good in human nature
across its narrow bounds. Words or expressions
did not occur to her; but a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
living thoughts swarmed in her mind. If
he would look at her again with reconciliation
in his eyes, she could be satisfied, and
bear all her future trials like benedictions.
Never a loving father, he was, until her disobedience,
a fairly kind one. He was a
very religious man of the old sort, believing
seriousness to be the primary principle of
godliness, and levity a fermentation of
the inward Satan. He always paid his
quarterage and contributed to foreign missions,
while every successive preacher on the
circuit used his house as home. The deep
grooves making a triangle of his upper lip
showed how constant and sad his meditations
had been. Yet this old farmer was in some
matters timid and self-distrustful, and so
fond of peace and quiet as to yield his rights
for them.</p>

<p>“Father,” pleaded Serena Hedding, bending
closer to him. “Father!” Unconsciously
she repeated the name like a cry.
The hum of the bee-hives against the garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
palings could be heard. Did a ray dart
across his leaden brain from the afternoon
his only child, in short coats, poked a stick
in the bee-hives, and, feeling the results of
her folly, wailed thus to him? Did he imagine
himself again dropping the rake and
leaping the fence to run with her from her
tormentors? A flicker grew through the
glazing of his eyes, and became a steady
light, a look, a tender gaze, a blessing. She
clasped her hands, and rocked before him in
ecstasy. He knew her, and revealed, midway
over the silent chasm of death, how unalterably
close and dear she was to him. In
that small eternity of time they were knitted
together as never before. His eyes began
to glaze again, and she remembered Milty.
Pushing the child forward, she cried again,
“My boy, father! See my boy!”</p>

<p>The old man saw him. That rigid face
was too set to smile, but with the image of his
child’s child on his eyes, the hope of future
generations of his blood, he passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>A little time was allowed for the wailing
that rises around every death-bed. The
overtaxed young widow rocked her son
against her, while he gazed about him in
awe. Aunt Lindy stood by the bedpost,
burying her face in her apron. Her son,
Hod Miller, a huge creature, very black-eyed,
bright-complexioned, and having the
appearance of possessing no immortal soul,
sat near the foot of the bed, with his legs
crossed and his shoulders hung forward,
looking respectfully concerned. There were
no other near relatives except Jesse Jeffries
and his wife, who covered their faces while
this elder brother lay in the first dignity of
death.</p>

<p>Then a quiet bustle began. Sister McGafferty
took Serena Hedding out of the
parlor, and made her lie down on the sitting-room
straw-tick lounge, and smell camphor.
Milty wandered out-of-doors, and was
grateful to a neighbor’s boy, forbidden the
house and enjoined to watch the horses, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
told him, after an exchange of scrutiny, that
he dursn’t take a dare which ’ud reach the
medder fence first. The men took charge
of the body. They closed the parlor doors,
and, with basins of water, clean linen, and
the new store suit Aunt Lindy’s forethought
had ready in the house, performed those
solemn rites to which all our flesh must
humbly come. One mounted a horse and
rode to Millersport for the undertaker. Little
Jimmy Holmes, who was a middle-aged
man, but had a father known as Old or Big
Jimmy, was informed by his wife that he
could go home now, and look after the
milkin’ and feedin’; she would stay here and
tend to things. Into her capable hands
Aunt Lindy appeared to resign the house,
while Little Jimmy and their son, Little
Jimmy’s Jimmy, drove into the pleasant
dusk.</p>

<p>After inquiring about the date of the
funeral, and detailing watchers for the intervening
nights, the other neighbors slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
dispersed in squads. Lights appeared about
the house, and the kitchen and cellar yielded
up their prepared good things.</p>

<p>Before they reached home the neighbors
began to speculate about the disposition of
the property. They said Moses Jeffr’s had
been a hard worker, and his sister Lindy
had been a hard worker, and she had kept
his house for more than twenty year:
’twouldn’t be no more than right for him
to leave her well off. She had been savin’
with what her man left her, and Hod Miller
had done a son’s part by the old man.
Money goes to them that lays up. Some
said Mr. Jeffr’s had cut off Sereny with a
cent in his will. Sereny ought to knowed
better than to done as she did. It was a
pity, specially as she was left a widow-woman,
with a little boy to raise. But when
a person makes their bed, they got to lie in
it. How tickled Mr. Jeffr’s was when
Sereny was a little girl experiencin’ religion!
He never thought then she would go and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
run off. She had a good home, and he
would have done well by her.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was folks-talk
among the Serena faction, whose hearts
melted toward the girl when she rocked before
her father. They said there never
would have been any trouble between Moses
Jeffr’s and his daughter if Lindy Miller
hadn’t managed things. Milt Heddin’ was
a good feller, only he hadn’t the knack of
gettin’ along. But he could have worked
the farm as well as Hod Miller. They
wanted Sereny to have her rights. It was a
scandal and a shame if that big, able-bodied
feller, with land of his own, could turn her
off the home place.</p>

<p>Serena wandered about the house, which
strangers seemed to possess, crying over familiar
objects. She had large violet eyes,
and was once considered as pretty a girl as
came to meeting, though her lips were too
prominent and full. She looked shabby and
piteous. Sister McGafferty combed her hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
for her, while her trembling, work-worn
hands lay in her lap.</p>

<p>“They’ve borried a black bonnet and
dress for you, Sister Sereny,” said the
elder’s wife, who had been around the circuit
when this sorrowful creature was a shy
child.</p>

<p>“I might have worn a better dress and
bonnet. But when word came, I felt so bad
I didn’t think of anything. They didn’t let
me know until he was near gone.”</p>

<p>Milty spent his time out-of-doors. He
approved of the barn, and did not approve
of Aunt Lindy. His mother had said,
“Aunt Lindy, this is my boy.”</p>

<p>And Aunt Lindy had said, “He looks
spindlin’, like the Heddin’s. I hope you’re
raisin’ him to obedience. Children set on
their own way gives their parents plenty of
sorrow to sup.”</p>

<p>This spry great-aunt’s glasses detected
him if he touched a daguerreotype among
the glaring, upright array on the sitting-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> 
table, or ventured too near the fine
men and women pasted on the fire-screen.</p>

<p>She took him to see his grandfather after
the laying-out, turned back the ghastly sheet,
which was stretched between two chairs, removed
cloths from the dead man’s face, and
warned the boy to prepare for death. He
never afterwards inhaled the pungent odor
of camphor without turning faint.</p>

<p>At table he and his mother huddled together,
feeling scarcely welcome to the abundant
food. Little Jimmy Holmes’s wife,
with a number of helpers, kept the table
burdened with every country luxury, but
Aunt Lindy saw that the best was reserved
until the great final dinner on the day of
the funeral.</p>

<p>That day was considered a credit to Moses
Jeffries. It was one of the largest funerals
ever known in those parts. The weather
was pleasant, and summer work so well advanced
that everybody could feel the pressure
of neighborly duty. Carriages and fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
horses nearly filled the orchard space in front
of the house; the yard was darkened with
standing men in their best black clothes.
Not half the people could get into the house,
to say nothing of getting into the parlor.
There Elder McGafferty lifted his hands,
praying and preaching over the old farmer,
who looked so unused to his collar and neck-cloth
and brand-new suit when they took off
his coffin-lid.</p>

<p>A number of men wandered down by the
barn; the hymn-singing came to them faint
and plaintive, in gusts of couplets, just as
the preacher lined the words.</p>

<p>One of them remarked that old Mr.
Jeffr’s left things in pretty good shape, and
he s’posed Hod Miller wouldn’t alter them
much. Another thought that Serene Heddin’
would come in for a sheer, if not all.
A man may be put out with his children,
but he’ll favor them when it comes to such
serious business as makin’ a will. Hod
Miller had bought and sold and made money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
on that farm, enough to pay for his work.
He oughtn’t to stand in Sereny’s light.</p>

<p>“What’s she been doin’ since her man
died?” inquired the first speaker, shaving
off long whittlings from a piece of pine.</p>

<p>“Workin’ out, ’pears like I heard. She
got a place near Lancaster, where they’d let
her keep her boy with her. It’s my opinion,”
said the second speaker, suddenly spitting
a flood, and letting his spiky chin work
up and down with slow rumination, “that
old Lindy kept her away from her pap as
long as she could, for fear there’d be a
makin’ up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sho! The old man was very set in
his ways. He didn’t need bully-raggin’ to
make up his mind and keep it made up.
Hod Miller might marry the widder now,
and that’d settle all claims.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she’d have him,” said
the chewer, smiling slowly. “Jesse Jeffr’s,
he thinks Sereny’s all right. He claims he
seen the will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>The whittler scoffed at such claims. Jesse
Jeffries was held in light esteem by his old
neighbors. He sold his farm, and had such
a hankering for town life as to settle in
Millersport, the Deep Cut of the Ohio canal,
and lose every cent of it in grocery-keeping.
What Jesse Jeffries said or did thereafter
was of small importance. His record slew
him.</p>

<p>There was bustle at the front of the
house. Both men squinted in the sun, and
watched a long black object with shining
dots upon it coming through the door, borne
by stout young farmers. The men in the
yard raised their hats. After the coffin
came Serena, on her Uncle Jesse’s arm. He
shuffled along uncomfortably, as if not used
to showing such attention to the women-folks.
After them came Hod Miller and
his mother, and Jesse Jeffries’ wife with Serena’s
boy. Sister McGafferty considered
this the proper order of procession, and had
so managed it. Streams of people gushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
from all the outlets of the house; the carriages
filled and were arrayed in line; the
long black serpent trailed down through the
woods; and the women remaining to prepare
dinner stood and counted, until they
declared it beat everything. It was a pleasant
sensation to be at such a populous
funeral.</p>

<p>When Jesse Jeffries foretold the contents
of the will he did not speak without authority,
for it had been left in his hands. After
a hearty dinner, at which many tablefuls of
neighbors assisted, he importantly called the
possible heirs together, and their factions
sat by to listen.</p>

<p>Aunt Lindy was neither nervous nor
bowed with grief. She had done her duty,
and knew what her deserts were. Her son
Hod tipped back in his chair, and twitched
his shirt-collar. He wanted to have the
thing over, and was not without doubts of
his succeeding to the estate. If it came to
him he meant to hold to it. His hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
were as strong as a vise, and typified his
grip on property. Serena might try to
break the will, but if she lawed until Judgment
Day he would not give her a cent he
was not obliged to give her. Women-folks
were a sort of cattle he had no fancy
for.</p>

<p>Curious eyes watched Serena, and speculated
on her emotions. She was pale and
quiet. Her son stood beside her.</p>

<p>The testator’s brother broke the seal, and
began to read.</p>

<p>The testator, after stating his sanity and
general ability to execute such a document,
giving the numbers of his various lands and
enumerating his parcels of property in the
tedious and high-sounding repetition prescribed
by law, bequeathed it all to his beloved
daughter Serena Jeffries, and her heirs,
the said Serena being enjoined to pay a
stated annuity to her aunt, the testator’s
beloved sister, and to make over to her certain
chattels particularly named; also a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
legacy of five hundred dollars to her cousin,
Howard Miller.</p>

<p>Sister McGafferty poked the camphor
bottle toward Serena, but it was declined.</p>

<p>Still the poor girl could not believe this.
Disinheritance had been so long accepted as
part of the penalty of her marriage that
she scarcely thought of it as injustice. But
to have the homestead for her own was a
rise which made her dizzy.</p>

<p>After gazing on her with satisfaction
through his glasses, Uncle Jesse turned the
paper over, and rapidly read a small codicil,
which nevertheless choked him. He knew
nothing about this part of the will. It
destroyed Serena Hedding’s claims, on account
of her disobedience, and made Howard
Miller unconditional heir.</p>

<p>So that settled the matter. Serena turned
whiter. It was a shock, after realizing one
instant the possession of competence.</p>

<p>“I ’low Mozy must have put that on the
day he took it away to have more added, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
said,” remarked Uncle Jesse huskily. His
good wife, who was all cap-rim and beak,
with a thin neck and general air of scrawniness,
sat with her claws crossed in silent
sympathy. Jesse and his wife did not find
Lindy a congenial sister.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Aunt Lindy, turning
her head so the light fell in a sheet of glare
upon her spectacles, “I’m satisfied. That
is, I will be when I’ve said what I’m goin’
to say. I’m a plain speaker, and tell my
mind. Things has turned out right. Sereny
Heddin’ left her pap, and we stayed by
him. She’s got her reward, and we’ve got
our’n. I hope you don’t take no exceptions
to his will, Sereny?”</p>

<p>Sereny replied in a low voice that she did
not take any.</p>

<p>“To show that I’m fair-minded and want
to do right by you,” said Aunt Lindy, raising
her voice to the tone she used in speaking-meeting
when exhorting sinners, “I’ll
give you your mother’s spinnin’-wheel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
stands in the smoke-house. You ought to
have something to remember her by.”</p>

<p>Little Jimmy Holmes’s wife nudged the
woman next to her, and whispered, with a
curving mouth, “Just the idy! And all
Sereny’s mother’s spoons, and her quilts
and coverlids she had wove! And the girl
never having any settin’-out in the first
place!”</p>

<p>Serena climbed the staircase, to take off
her borrowed mourning, and put on her own
shabby weeds for her ride back into the
world. She passed presses stacked with
household linen. The precious things of
her childhood, seen and handled in this trying
visit, seemed so heart-breakingly precious
because Hod Miller’s future wife would
throw them about as common. She would
like to have the yellow, leather-bound copy
of “Alonzo and Melissa,” the novel of the
house, always considered unwholesome by
the elders, and as surely read with sly zest
by the children. The coverlet with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
mother’s name woven into it had never been
intended for anybody but the daughter of
the house. It was unendurable to go away
from home this second time, and into perpetual
exile.</p>

<p>“Now I wisht they’d find a later will,”
said Little Jimmy Holmes’s wife, tying on
her bonnet in the best bedroom. The persons
who had lingered to support the family
through the ordeal of will-reading were driving
off, one after another. “Oh, but Aunt
Lindy’ll carry things before her! Is she
anywhere near? I don’t want her to hear
me.”</p>

<p>“Things don’t turn out that way except
in novel-stories,” observed another woman,
with her mouth full of pins. “They don’t
find wills hid around in stockin’s or Bibles.
I declare, I’m real sorry for Sereny. I
don’t see how old Mr. Jeffr’s can lay easy in
his grave, turnin’ his own child out to give
place to a big, hearty feller, with money in
his own right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“I always thought so much of Serene,”
said Little Jimmy Holmes’s wife. “We
was taken into full church membership on
the same day; and we used to run together
and swap dinners at the Gum College. Aunt
Lindy was so hard on her. I’ve asked
Serene to go home with me and stay as long
as she wanted to. But she has to take that
horse and buggy back. And I don’t think
she could stand it, so near the old home.”</p>

<p>“Now what do you think?” said Jesse
Jeffries’ wife, coming in, with her black-mitted
hands pressed together. “Things is
willed to Sereny, after all.”</p>

<p>The bedroom resounded with ejaculations.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” inquired
Little Jimmy Holmes’s wife. “I’d give all
my yearlin’ calves to have it so.”</p>

<p>“There was another piece wrote on to
the paper, that Jesse missed. ’Pears like
Mozy cut her off, and then repented, and
went right to another lawyer and had it
fixed, for it’s in two different handwrites.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Things stands just as they did in the
first.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Lindy gets her yearly portion,”
said Mrs. Holmes, in an irreverent
aside. “Let me get out of this crowd: I’m
goin’ to hug Serene.”</p>

<p>“I <i>thought</i> ’twas a great pity,” exclaimed
the woman with pins in her mouth, bestowing
them rapidly about her bonnet ribbons,
“if Sereny couldn’t have the homestead to
bring up her boy in!”</p>

<p>“You said folks never found new wills!”
observed a neighbor triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” retorted the woman, turning her
face from side to side to get her chin set
properly in the bonnet ribbons, “they <i>didn’t</i>
find any. Jesse Jeffr’s only fooled around
and didn’t read all of the first one. They
might ’a’ knowed <i>Jesse Jeffr’s</i> ’ud make a
mess of it. <i>He</i> don’t know how to do a
thing right.”</p>

<p>This opinion was shielded from the ear of
Mrs. Jesse. She was busy nodding her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
leghorn bonnet and exchanging parting civilities
with several old neighbors.</p>

<p>But Little Jimmy Holmes’s wife had
flown upstairs, and interfered with Jesse
Jeffries and Sister McGafferty and a number
of others. Serena lay upon a bed, and
the air reeked with camphor.</p>

<p>“She’s overcome like,” explained Uncle
Jesse.</p>

<p>“Let me get to her,” said Mrs. Holmes.
Having got to her, Mrs. Holmes raised
Serena’s head on her arm, and began to
laugh.</p>

<p>“She’s comin’ out of it now,” observed
Sister McGafferty. “All of you’d better
go downstairs except Sister Holmes and
me. Let her be without disturbin’ a while.
We’ll have plenty of other chances to enjoy
Sister Heddin’s company.”</p>

<p>The neighbors and Jesse went submissively
downstairs, but Little Jimmy Holmes’s
wife kept on laughing with some effort, as
if she felt afraid of ending in a sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Oh, I’m so glad you’ll be in the neighborhood
again, Serene!” she said. “Things
wouldn’t never been right in this world if
they’d turned out the other way. Don’t
look at me like you’s thinkin’ of the dead.
But rouse up and feel better. There’s your
Aunt Lindy and Hod standin’ at the gate:
I can see ’em through the winder. They’re
talkin’ mighty serious, and she don’t look
so well satisfied as she did. But you must
do well by her, Sereny. Give her the old
spinnin’-wheel that stands in the smoke-house!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">ROSE DAY</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1875</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I do</span> believe this is rose day,” said Infant,
standing on the top step of the veranda
in delight.</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> it’s soap-boiling day,” asserted
her twin sister, who had been baptized
Marilla Victoria when she was baptized Infanta
Isabella, quite forty years before.
These twins entered the world at a period
when flowery, daring names were the extreme
of fashion, and previous to a rebound
to plain and strong Ann, Elizabeth, Mary,
Hannah, Jane, and their various combinations.
Infant came very near being labeled
Lovey Lucilla, and she felt thankful for
her escape, and even attached to her diminutive.</p>

<p>Belle would never have suited her (she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
was not belle), while Infant did not shame
her (she was more or less an infant at any
age). She was slender, blue-eyed, and
smooth-skinned, so smooth that wrinkles
could scarcely make their indentation. And
it never ceased to be appropriate for her to
wear her hair in a braid down her back,
tied with ribbons the color of the dress she
wore. Infant herself could not separate the
gray hair from the blond, nor did she care
whether it was all blond or all gray. She
scampered over a fence and swung in the
cherry-trees. Her long tranced girlhood
never ended; and the slow life of the farm,
simple as grass and wholesome as new milk,
kept up the illusion that time was eternity.
In their neighborhood these twins had been
the Baldwin girls when they first toddled
into meeting, when they went off to be
educated at an expensive school, when they
came back to paint and to play on a grand
piano, when their parents died and they
took charge of the farm; and the Baldwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
girls would probably be their title when
they should become contemporary with all
living grandmothers.</p>

<p>Occasionally Infant received a shock from
the growth of young children. It was so
astonishing to see a creature who was a baby
but a short time ago, shooting aloft, long-armed
and long-legged, and announcing
itself in the teens. Such phenomena did not
astonish Rilla, however. She resented them.
Though she had the same fair complexion
and comely make as her sister, a deadly drop
of acid had been added to her nature. Her
shoulders were bent. She loved to hear
people talked about, and to lift the corners
of her nose with scorn. She felt abused by
much that had happened to her on this
planet, and yet too insignificant in her own
personality to take it out of the human race
as she desired to do. The freedom, ease,
and scope of mature unmarried womanhood
were in no wise appreciated by her. These
traits made Rilla an uncomfortable house-mate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> 
especially in winter, when the twins
were snowed in with their books and trim
housekeeping. Still, Infant loved Rilla’s
sourness along with Rilla. There was strong
diversion in being scolded, and she always
felt such a delicious warmth around her
heart when she made it up with Rilla and
gave her a handsome present, or took double
turns at the cooking.</p>

<p>Rilla was very parsimonious, and felt
bound to distort herself with aged gowns and
long-hoarded hats. But Infant felt unhappy
in any color except that tint of gray which
has the thought of wine in it. On this very
rose day, though it was early in the morning,
she wore a clinging gray challie dress.
And a good background it would be for all
the roses Infant could hang upon it.</p>

<p>Nothing made Rilla lift the corners of
her nose higher than Infant’s flower days.
But as Rilla would be lifting her nose anyhow,
and could really scent no harm in these
silent festivals, Infant continued to observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
them year after year, and to afford her sister
that triumphant sense of superiority which
we all have upon beholding others’ absurdities.</p>

<p>There was crocus day, when the first
flowers broke the sod and made heavenly
beauty in the dark spring. Infant decked
herself with them, and put them on the dinner-table.
More abundantly satisfactory,
however, was lilac day. It took a critical
eye to discern the exact date. If the lilacs
browned about the edges, then, alas! lilac
day had slipped past. They were not to be
gathered too soon, either, if their full soul
of fragrance was to be enjoyed. On lilac
day Infant walked under burdens of lavender
bloom. The walls, the pictures, breathed
lilacs. And at night she went to sleep crushing
her face into a nest of bunches, so that
she had lilac dreams, and drew the sweetness
into herself, like an Eastern woman absorbing
roses.</p>

<p>But the best day of all was rose day. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
it arrived she had always ready a posy
of poems from Keats, Wordsworth, Jean Ingelow,
and Whittier, and read them in the
morning while the dew was on the world.
The Baldwin girls cultivated a great many
roses. Rilla could hardly miss from her
rose-water and home-made attar and rose
preserves the heaps which Infant cut for her
nonsense.</p>

<p>There was not a nicer day in the year
than rose day, if Rilla would only abstain
from boiling soap on that date. The sisters
had inherited seventy-five thousand dollars
apiece, but they made their own soap every
spring of refuse fats and the lye of wood-ashes.
It could have been made cold in the
cellar, if that way had not been too easy for
Rilla. She held it a movable festival, like
rose day, and no one will ever gauge the
degree of satisfaction she felt in haling her
flower-wreathed sister up to the vile-smelling
caldron to keep the stirrer going while she
set about other duties. Rilla honored pioneer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
custom and her grandmother’s memory by
performing her soap incantations in the oldest,
mouldiest, most completely shattered
garment she possessed. This was a red
wool delaine, so abased from its ruby tone
that the drippings of the lye gourd could
find little remaining space to burn or spot.</p>

<p>They boiled soap in a huge iron kettle in
the chip yard. The blue wood smoke would
envelop Rilla and her tarnished tatters as
she ladled and tested, until she looked witch-like
to passers along the road. Her unhappy
victim, the slim woman in gray, with a rope
of roses wound spirally around her from
head to foot, a burden of roses on her bosom,
and roses studded thickly along the band of
her hat, sat on the corded wood as far as
Rilla would allow from the soap, alternately
inhaling their odor and rejecting the alkali
steam. If Infant had to stir the soap, she
would have a long-handled stirrer. The hot
sun, beating on the chip yard and her huge
hat, smote also the roses, and amidst their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
dying fragrance she had sad thoughts on
the disappointments of life. So there was
nothing but the morning of rose day which
Rilla did not spoil.</p>

<p>But this anniversary Infant felt a sudden
uplifting of courage within herself when her
twin announced the soap orgy.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> soap-boiling will not come any more
on rose day,” she put forth strongly. “And
I think I will pay Enos Robb’s wife to make
up my share of the fat and lye after this,
Rilla.”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Rilla sarcastically, “particularly
as Enos Robb and his wife and
children don’t batten on us already. Give
them the piano and the best parlor chairs
and the solid coffee service while you are
about it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Rilla, I didn’t propose to give
her my share of the soap. But it would be
cheaply got rid of that way. Yes,” exclaimed
Infant, with sudden recklessness, “I would
rather <i>buy</i> soap, and pay out money to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
this dirty stuff carted off, than ever smell it
again while I live. Let us make a new
rule, and give our fat and ashes to the
Robbs. They have farmed for us ever since
father died,” Infant pleaded, “and whatever
you say, Rilla, I know you have the greatest
confidence in them.”</p>

<p>“The poorhouse wagon is never going to
call for me,” said Rilla decidedly. “You
can go and build a fire under the kettle,
while I carry some more water to pour on
the ash-hopper. That lye is strong enough
to bear up a setting of eggs, but we may
need some more a little weaker.”</p>

<p>“Rilla, I am as firm as the ash-hopper
itself. You can’t shake me any more than
you could our brick smoke-house. I won’t
help make any more soap—especially on
rose day,” added Infant to herself. “I
don’t see any sense in it.”</p>

<p>“But you can see sense in spoiling dozens
of good roses to load yourself up with like a
mad Ophelia. You feel above all the associations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of wash day, though the Princess
Nausicaa didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rilla, I don’t feel above anything.
I merely feel under that soap kettle, and as
if it would crush my soul out, as the shields
crushed Tarpeia, if I didn’t throw it off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am going to make soap,” said
Rilla, whitening with intense disapproval of
the liberty her twin proposed to grasp.
“You are not a minor, and if you were, I’m
not your guardian. But if you propose to
go to yourself and leave me to myself, we
both know what belongs to us, and it is
easily done.”</p>

<p>This time-worn hint, which in her girlhood
used to startle and distress Infant so
much, made but the slightest impression on
her hearing now, as she leaned over the
veranda railing to look at the roses. There
were such abundant stacks of them: she
might cut and pile them into a pyramid
almost as tall as herself. Such smooth,
sweet tea-roses, such crimson velvet-petaled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Jacqueminots, blush and white so fragrant
you would be willing to drown yourself in a
sea of their scent; yellow roses piercingly
delightful, Prairie Queens creeping all over
the front of the house, old hundred-leaved
varieties, having always in their depths a
reminder of grandmother’s chests and long,
long past days. There were eighteen distinct
families of roses, each family a mighty
tribe, marshaled before Infant on lawn and
dewy stretch of garden. It was rose day.
She would not let herself think of anything
else.</p>

<p>Rilla would not come to the embowered
dinner-table which Infant prepared so carefully,
and to which she called her sister exactly
as the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>Rose day never interfered with Infant’s
duties. Her conscience acquitted her of
shirking. Often in dead winter-time, when
the snow piled up, and Enos Robb’s family
settled down to the enjoyment of colds and
rheumatism, she fed all the stock herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Rilla turned her back on Infant’s several
approaches, and dipped lye with a savagely
noisy gourd to quench Infant’s voice. Slugs
and ants in the roses, and even mildew, were
no drawback at all to rose day compared to
Rilla. Habits of endurance become proof
armor to one’s sensibilities in the course of
life, however; so Infant wandered off and
absorbed the beauty of that day almost as
completely as if she did so with Rilla’s
approval. There was tremulous heat over
the meadows. The huge and strictly tended
garden was a world by itself. Beyond that
stretched their orchard, having a run of
clear water winding through it, all thickly
tufted along the margins with mint.</p>

<p>Infant stepped upon the spongy lichens
of the fence and rested her arms on the top
rail, while she looked along the narrow country
thoroughfare. The sweet green world
was dear enough to be pressed in her arms.
Mingled mint and rose scents were satisfying.
The noble strength of their Norman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
colts pasturing in the stock meadow was
beautiful to the eye. Infant loved to hear
the pounding of those tufted feet, and to
note the brilliant blackness or gray dappling
of the young creatures’ coats glistening in
the sun. She did not expect anything more
unusual to happen on this rose day than her
rebellion against Rilla and the splendor of
the weather.</p>

<p>But who should come suddenly riding
along the road, as if he had an appointment
with Infant, and meant to keep it the moment
she set her foot on the rail, but the
Honorable Truman Condit, who many years
before rode as instantaneously out of her
sight! She knew him in a flash, although
his hair showed gray around the ears, and
much experience had added unspeakably to
his personality. He was on a Condit horse,
evidently riding around to look at his old
neighborhood. There was a great tribe of
the Condits, all well-to-do, high-headed people.
The Honorable Truman had been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
local bright young man of his generation.
He went west, where, Infant heard, he became
a Senator and did tremendous things.</p>

<p>She was suddenly conscious that her rose-studded
braid was not wound up in a decent
lump as she wore it before her class of
young ladies in Sunday-school. She felt
contemptible and out of her place in the
human procession, although the Honorable
Truman turned his horse straight into the
fence corner to shake hands with her.</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly the same Infant Baldwin,”
he remarked. “But I do see some lines on
your face.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ve vegetated instead of
lived all the time you have been doing so
much,” said Infant.</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t been doing so much.”</p>

<p>“We heard you had.”</p>

<p>“We means Rilla and you. And you
didn’t marry?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Infant, feeling it a stinging
indignity that he should mention it, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
that courtship so long ago buried. <i>He</i> had
married, and raised a family out west.
Rilla was probably right when she said
one woman was the same as another to a
man.</p>

<p>“And how is Rilla? Is she as hard on
you as she used to be?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rilla was never hard on <i>me</i>. She
is quite well, thank you. You’re coming
up to the house to make us a call and take
tea, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I thought I would.”</p>

<p>Infant looked anxiously at the westering
sun. She hoped Rilla would have the cold
soap cut into cakes and boxed, and herself
bathed, clothed, and in her right mind,
before the Honorable Truman Condit rode
up to their door.</p>

<p>“I want to have a talk with you first,
though,” he added. “And my way is to go
right to the point. Why did you never
marry?”</p>

<p>“Come to that,” retorted Infant, a sparkle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
breaking through her face, “why did
<i>you marry</i>?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, because you wouldn’t
have me, and in the second place, because I
found a very good wife where I went. I’ve
been a widower now several years, and the
boys are settled. I’m loose from business
for almost the first time in my life, and back
here to look at the old neighborhood before
spending some years abroad. Your never
marrying has revived certain things. Maybe
you’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>Among her other thoughts, Infant was
conscious of recollecting how often she had
wished to go abroad if only some happy
friend could go along as a cushion betwixt
Rilla and her. She unfastened with a furtive
hand the rose rope wound about her, but,
unwilling to let so many precious roses go,
gathered it into loops on her arm.</p>

<p>“Did you ever know,” pursued the Honorable
Truman, “that Rilla told me you
were going to marry one of the Pierson
boys?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“No!” Infant cried out so suddenly that
the horse started.</p>

<p>“She did,” said the Honorable Truman.</p>

<p>“Why,” stammered Infant, “how could
you believe it?”</p>

<p>“I was a hot-headed boy with more pride
than sense. I wouldn’t say anything to you
about it.”</p>

<p>“I remember your quarreling with the
Piersons.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you engaged to one of them?”</p>

<p>“No; which one?”</p>

<p>“Abner.”</p>

<p>“I never was engaged to anybody except
you,” she retorted, burning hotly in the face,
“and I did not admire that experience when
you dropped me and went off. And I don’t
yet, though you do lay the blame on poor
Rilla.”</p>

<p>Plenty of time had Rilla for all the domestic
countermarching she wished to perform
before that conference by the fence
ended. Unusually stirring were her tactics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
too, for all the Robbs were haled up from
the tenant-house—Mrs. Robb to cook a
supper, and the young Robbs not actually
farming to run on errands.</p>

<p>It was six o’clock when Enos came riding
his plough-horses to the great barn. He
had turned off early on purpose to intercept
Miss Infant and find out what changes were
to be made. Infant hastened up the orchard,
while the Honorable Truman hastened
to the same destination by the road. She
saw him leading his horse up the avenue,
and felt impatient at Enos Robb’s interruption.</p>

<p>“Sudden doin’s up to the house,” said
Enos, wiping his forehead with the back of
his hand. “’Pears like Miss Rill’s made
up her mind about Brother Sanderson at
last.”</p>

<p>“Is Brother Sanderson at the house?”
inquired Infant.</p>

<p>“He is, for a fact, and the license and
the preacher with him. Now what I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
to know, and what I ought to been consulted,
Miss Infant, seeing how long I been
here, is this—what’s you and me going to
do afterward? Is it an interference?”</p>

<p>“Enos,” said Infant, with a gasp, “this
is <i>almost</i> as sudden to me as it is to you.
But considering Rilla’s firm character, do
you think she would let any new person
interfere with her established plans?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” replied Enos, grinning.</p>

<p>Rilla was standing before the dresser in
her room arrayed in her stiffest silk. She
looked with composure upon her twin, who
shut the bedroom door, and hurried up to
embrace her.</p>

<p>“It was the best boiling of soap I ever
had,” said Rilla, warding the fading roses
away from her silk.</p>

<p>“Rilla dear, you might have told me
what you meant to do this evening. But
I am so glad! I couldn’t bear the thoughts
of leaving you before, but now I can.”</p>

<p>“I saw Truman Condit come into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
yard with you,” said Rilla. “He’s grown
fat. It must have agreed with him to go
west.”</p>

<p>“This has been a great rose day,”
said her twin, undoing all traces of the day’s
festival, and piling them carefully in a waste-basket
where they could make no litter.
“Won’t you let me kiss you, Rilla?”</p>

<p>The acquiescent nip which Rilla gave
Infant took up a world of forgiveness which
Rilla never felt.</p>

<p>“And do you think, dear,” Infant ventured,
“we’ll ever wish we hadn’t? We’ve
lived so long with each other. Truman
Condit and Brother Sanderson are really
strangers to our ways.”</p>

<p>“I think,” replied Rilla, with decision,
“that Brother Sanderson will never have a
rose day while he lives on <i>my</i> farm; and
when I say it is soap-boiling day it will <i>be</i>
soap-boiling day, and Brother Sanderson
will stir the soap.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1857</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> perfection of summer noon, when
acres of corn tassels seemed in a trance and
the blueness of far-off hills suggested incense
rising, was not without its effect on
Miss Sally Vandewater as she rode toward
General Poynton’s plantation. The turnpike,
stretching its ash-colored ribbon across
the greenness of the country, rang like a
causeway of rock to the beat of horseshoes.</p>

<p>From this plantation or from that, as hill
or sweep of woodland revealed them, shone
marble stones in family burial lots.</p>

<p>Occasionally Miss Sally met girls or young
men on dashing horses, and these merry
people saluted her cordially in passing. But
in all that blue-grass region, where each
member of every comfortable family had his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
own gaited saddle-horse, there was not a
finer animal than Miss Sally’s Pacer. Cæsar
and his fortune were aboard when she
mounted. Pacer was her entire capital in
life, carrying her on visits among good families
whereby she subsisted, and furnishing
colts for her pin-money. The camel is not
more to the Bedouin. Had Pacer failed
Miss Sally in any point, she must have fallen
into the straits of a reduced gentlewoman,
instead of carrying a high head through all
the best houses of the county.</p>

<p>She rode at a steady hand gallop through
the sultry day, though a young colt whinnied
behind her; increasing her speed past one
pillared brick house set far up an avenue.
The woods about it were close trimmed and
free from underbrush, like all Kentucky
woodland. Some evergreens made gloom
about its eaves, but not such gloom as the
reputation of the house itself. There lived a
man who was said to have a chain stretched
across his cellar. He bought up slaves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
handcuffed them in pairs along this chain
until he was ready to drive them to market,
when a band of musicians was employed to
lead their march, cheerfully playing “Yankee
Doodle.” The house was worse than haunted.
Both whites and blacks hurried past its
handsome gate with abhorrence—spot of
mystery and abomination on those pleasant
corn lands.</p>

<p>Miss Sally was anxious to get out of her
riding-skirt at Poynton’s, and bully the black
boy who would come to take her bridle.
The wealthiest slave-owner in Kentucky
could not exact more deference. Everybody
humored her. In a country where hospitality
was a social religion, her little visits of a
month or two were welcomed even when
they crowded dearer guests. And in spite
of fine traits concealed under the haughty
airs of a nomad, well did she know how to
crowd people distasteful to her.</p>

<p>When she turned into Poynton’s avenue,
the white pillared mansion seemed to doze.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
The quarters stretched in a long row fieldward.
Miss Sally could not see the kitchen,
standing by itself behind the great house.
No drowsiness had settled there. A stir of
preparation was going on, not only for the
two o’clock dinner, but for the wedding yet
a week distant. Miss Sally had omitted one
place in her rounds, and shortened her visit
at another, that she might be at Poynton’s
in time to gather every detail of the wedding.</p>

<p>A yellow boy skipped out to help her at
the mounting-block. He would have lounged
to meet his master. Approvingly she saw
him pull his hat to her.</p>

<p>“Miss Sally, you sho’ly bake you’se’f to-day!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s hot, Peach. And if you’re
concerned for me I hope you’ll feel more
concern about Pacer.” Miss Vandewater’s
anxiety about her property grew in the ratio
of its approach to a crib.</p>

<p>“Sam’ll rub her down,” promised Peachy.
“I’ll tell Sam to give her a good feed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“You attend to it yourself,” commanded
Miss Sally.</p>

<p>“I isn’t a stable-boy,” remonstrated
Peachy. “I’se a house-boy.”</p>

<p>“House-boy or stable-boy, you mind what
I tell you. In my father’s time—and he
owned fifty—our boys did whatever they
were told to do.”</p>

<p>“Ya-as, m’m.”</p>

<p>“And the poor little colt,” said Miss
Sally, making that infant’s discomfort her
own,—“I don’t want my colt kicked to
death among a lot of wild shod heels.”</p>

<p>“He go with his mammy. No ha’um
evah happen to you’ colts on this place, Miss
Sally.”</p>

<p>“You see to it that none happens to it
this time! All the family at home?” she
stopped to inquire, with her riding-skirt
gathered in her hand.</p>

<p>“Ya-as, m’m.”</p>

<p>“Has my trunk been carried up? I sent
it this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Ya-as, m’m.”</p>

<p>“Who’s here?” demanded Miss Vandewater,
stiffening her figure.</p>

<p>Peachy followed her eye to the stable-yard,
where stood a vehicle she never beheld
with calmness. It was the handsome and
shining carriage of Judge Poynton, from
the county seat.</p>

<p>Peachy grinned. “Miss Judge come out
this mawnin’ to spend the day.”</p>

<p>So sore does one’s pride become when
chafed by poverty, that Miss Sally hated that
plump and opulent woman for naught but
being plump and opulent; though she would
have given as her reason the airs of a woman
married above her wildest expectations.</p>

<p>“You can fetch my riding-skirt to my
room, Nancy,” said Miss Sally to the colored
girl who admitted her, casting it across the
stair-rail as she ascended. “I reckon I go
to the same room I always have.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ma’ky’s things is all spread out in
that bedroom,” apologized Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“You can soon move them out of the
way.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Maria ’bleeged to have you’
trunk set in the back bedroom fo’ this week,
Miss Sally.”</p>

<p>A solicitous hostess, trailing a muslin
wrapper—for even Kentucky hospitality
may be overpowered by the languors of
summer midday—met the guest with outstretched
hands. Miss Sally permitted her
cheek to be brushed, and at once put the
lady into the apologetic attitude of an overcrowded
landlord.</p>

<p>“You ought to have sent me word if it
was inconvenient to have me now, Mrs.
Poynton, and I wouldn’t have skipped the
Moores as I did.”</p>

<p>“Miss Sally, it is not inconvenient to have
you now!” the delinquent pleaded. “It is
never inconvenient. Only America’s things
are so spread out, and we are obliged to
keep dressing-rooms for the wedding, and
the bridesmaids! I thought you would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
less annoyed in that back room than anywhere
else. I am so glad you have come!”</p>

<p>“The judge’s wife is here?”</p>

<p>“But it is only for the day,” unconsciously
conciliated Mrs. Poynton. “She is not
staying. Sue Bet Moore has been here,
helping America to try on. Her dresses are
all done. But Sue Bet has gone.”</p>

<p>“I knew Sue Bet was to be one of the
bridesmaids,” said Miss Sally. It was not
necessary to mention bridesmaids to a woman
of her thorough information.</p>

<p>“We have all been lying down; the day
is so sultry. We shall not have America’s
things filling up the chambers much longer.
I feel like giving her all the rooms in the
house—yes, the plantation itself! If you
can only make yourself comfortable a few
days, we can change your room after the
wedding.”</p>

<p>“The back bedroom makes not the slightest
difference in the world to me, Mrs.
Poynton”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“O Miss Sally, I am so glad it makes no
difference!”</p>

<p>—“but I am sorry I came at such an
inconvenient time!”</p>

<p>Thus the duet went on, until Mrs. Poynton
accepted as positive beneficence Miss
Sally Vandewater’s willingness to descend
from the back chamber, dine with the family,
and sit down in the parlor.</p>

<p>Miss Sally had kept her sprightliness and
her youthful shape. Her muslin dress was
cut low, and her shoulders were concealed
by a bertha of lace. Fine embroidered undersleeves
made delicate frills about her
folded hands. The curling-iron had created
two large spirals at each temple, but the
rest of her hair was pinned in a knot at the
back of her head.</p>

<p>America Poynton came into the parlor in
her tight-fitting habit of black velvet, and
sat down with the guests, holding her riding-whip,
her gauntlets, and tall hat.</p>

<p>“Are you going to ride in this heat?”
inquired her aunt, the judge’s wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“We always ride Thursday afternoons,
about four o’clock, if the weather is fine,”
America replied.</p>

<p>She looked no less cool and white in the
heavy fabric than in a gold dotted vaporous
tissue which she had worn at dinner. Her
black eyes moved with languid interest from
speaker to speaker as the visiting chat ran
on. America Poynton was called the proudest
girl who ever appeared in the county
seat from surrounding plantations. The
manners of this tall beauty were considered
too quiet by romping young people who
danced, drove, and flirted to the limit of
their privileges; yet she was sovereign
among them, and ruled by a look while
others expended noisy effort. It was told
of her that she often sat veiled in her room
to save her complexion from sun glare and
wind, so matchless was it. She had a robe
of black curls in which she could wrap herself
when her maid let it down to brush.
America was General Poynton’s only child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
She had inherited from her grandmother a
plantation adjoining her father’s, with more
than a hundred slaves. When she went to
boarding-school in the county town, one of
her servants led to her every pleasant Friday
evening a milk-white mule, saddled
and bridled with silk, fine leather, and
silver.</p>

<p>Though above such pastime as flirtation,
America had more offers than any other girl
in her set. Her low, slow voice never recounted
these conquests, but the victims published
themselves, wondering whom America
Poynton would marry, since she was so hard
to suit. When she accepted Ross Carr,
therefore, the astonishment was general. He
was good enough for some girls, but hardly
good enough for America Poynton. He
had also been a wild youth, but people said
he was settling down. The Carrs ranked
somewhat below the Poyntons, and Ross had
no plantation of his own. Yet when the
community thought it over, they were willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to accept him as America’s husband if he
proved a credit to her.</p>

<p>“Miss Maria,” said Nancy, coming to the
door with a face full of meaning, “Miss
Becky Inchbald’s done lighted down by the
quarters, and tied her horse.”</p>

<p>“What does she want?” inquired Mrs.
Poynton, disturbed.</p>

<p>“Dunno, Miss Maria.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t she come to the house?”</p>

<p>“She hardly ever came to the house
in her best days,” murmured the judge’s
wife.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she’s sick,” continued Mrs.
Poynton. “Some of you run and see.”</p>

<p>“Peachy done been down to her, and she
say she just waitin’ there in the shade.
Miss Becky got her baby ’long with her.”</p>

<p>The general’s wife heard this with rising
dignity.</p>

<p>“Don’t annoy her,” she commanded.
“Let the poor girl alone.”</p>

<p>“Law, Miss Maria, nobody won’t say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
nothin’ to Miss Becky. But all the little
niggehs has come out to look at her.”</p>

<p>“Go yourself and see if she needs anything.”</p>

<p>“I have heard,” remarked Miss Vandewater,
through the silence which followed,
“that Becky Inchbald, for all she was so
close-mouthed at first, threatens now to
carry her child to its father.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Poynton, with an instant’s pause on
the subject, hoped he could be found and
made to do his duty. The judge’s wife
heard with a mere lifting of the eyebrows.
She thought it scarcely a fit topic to mention
before America. But America’s plane was
so much above Becky Inchbald that she had
never even disapproved of the girl.</p>

<p>Becky Inchbald’s people were not poor
whites, for they owned land and slaves; but
their raw unfitness for encountering the old
stock held them on the verge of society.
That Becky was uneducated was her own
fault. She had become the mother of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
hapless baby and the scandal of the neighborhood
before America Poynton’s engagement
was announced.</p>

<p>“She’s spiteful about that baby,” pursued
Miss Sally. “There’ll be trouble
somewhere before sundown, if she’s started
out with it.”</p>

<p>“I do not see that Inchbald’s affairs
need disturb us,” suggested the judge’s wife,
making dimples at the finger roots of one
hand as she smoothed her polished hair.</p>

<p>“Some women are never disturbed about
any of the sin in the world,” said Miss
Vandewater incisively, “until it comes into
their houses and takes their children by the
throat.”</p>

<p>“That can never be said of you, Miss
Sally,” the judge’s indolent wife responded,
smiling. Though she generally bore Miss
Sally’s attacks as a lady should, and felt
indulgent sympathy for the migratory spinster,
she sometimes allowed herself to retort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Aunt and Miss Sally, kiss and make
up,” said America, with the deliberate accent
that gave weight to all her words. But without
response one of the combatants sat
glowering, while the other, waving a lazy
fan, indicated through the window Ross Carr
cantering to his appointment, man and
steed moving like one, so perfect was his
horsemanship.</p>

<p>America’s mother, impatiently anxious to
go on recounting to Miss Sally the silver
and linen bought for America’s new home,
resigned herself for a few moments. Ross
Carr threw his bridle to the groom, who was
walking Miss Poynton’s saddled thoroughbred.</p>

<p>He entered the room. America gave him
her hand with a light word, and he stood
holding his hat, talking to her elders.</p>

<p>It was the culminating moment of her
betrothal, a dot of time separating ease and
care-free thoughts from what followed.</p>

<p>The young man chatted idly with four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
women, when another screamed out behind
him:—</p>

<p>“Here it is, Ross Carr! So you’ve got
to take it, and no words betwixt us—for I
won’t take care of it any longer!”</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Becky!—why, Miss Becky!”
Mrs. Poynton herself ran gasping forward
to interpose between such scandalous outcry
and America’s lover. “Come away with me,
Miss Becky, and let me help you with your
baby—and don’t speak that way before
the gentlemen!”</p>

<p>A shaker bonnet fell back from the girl’s
hot and furious face. She had narrow
sunken temples like a hen’s. Her entire
profile was chicken beaked, yet a fluff of
golden down made her comely. The wrathful
rings in her eyes sent out their fires
toward Ross Carr.</p>

<p>“He thinks he’s a great gentleman, and
he thinks he’s going to get a great lady”—</p>

<p>“Becky Inchbald, sit down in that chair!”
commanded America, standing at the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
side of the room. Her hat and gloves and
whip lay on the floor. The other women,
even her mother, waited, sitting blanched.</p>

<p>Carr remained with his hand on the back
of the chair, like a frozen figure, while Becky
Inchbald placed herself in it and stretched
the baby across her lap. Her first courage
leaving her, she began to cry.</p>

<p>The men of the west do not cower when
found out in their sins. Ross Carr stood
six feet and one inch high; a handsome,
light-haired Kentuckian, the man most abundant
in vitality, and the best horseman in
Bourbon County. A culprit waiting to be
shot, he looked his death in the face, erect,
but blighted through every outline. He had
carried this guilt a long time, trying to
shape it for disclosure; while day after day
continued to separate him farther from the
Ross Carr of the past, and to make more incomprehensible
the deeds which he inherited
from that miserable wretch.</p>

<p>When you or I stand, on our day of judgment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to be looked at through the dark
medium of our basest moments, may some
eye among our contemners discern the angel
shape struggling in remorse and anguish behind
the bar.</p>

<p>“Is this your child?” America demanded
of her lover, pointing to it for his identification.</p>

<p>The baby, oppressed by the jaunt, under
arm, or on lap, according to its mother’s convenience
in riding, was covered all over its
visible surface by that prickly rash which
nurses call “heat.” It was gowned in pink
calico, and diffused a sour odor.</p>

<p>Ross Carr looked down at it with the
slighting masculine eye, which since Saturn
has seen little to admire in extremely young
offspring. He controlled the muscles of his
lips to reply.</p>

<p>“I reckon it is.”</p>

<p>“Answer me on your word as a man—is
this your child?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“He knows it’s his, and he’s got to take
care of it and support it—it’s his place to
take care of it, not mine,” sobbed Becky, her
head wagging.</p>

<p>America directed her face to Becky.
“Do you intend to turn it off entirely?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I do! It’s his, and he ought to
keep it!”</p>

<p>“But you are its mother!”</p>

<p>“I won’t be its mother!” exploded Becky,
flinging the ill-kept and wretched infant
about on her knees with a vicious grip. “I’ll
leave it on a doorstep first!”</p>

<p>The child put up a piteous lip and uttered
those cries by which bruised infancy protests
against tormentors whom it feels but
does not know.</p>

<p>America stared at the girl; her alabaster
face was suddenly drained of horror at the
wrong done a woman, and filled with passionate
contempt.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll be its mother! Give it to
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>She gathered it off Becky’s lap and laid
its heat-blotched face against her shoulder.
The tiny creature discharged a mouthful of
its wretchedness there. America stanched
the spot, and made a softer rest for its cheek
with her rose-scented handkerchief. Her
unconscious sweep of figure in taking the
child and standing up publicly with it,
thrilled beholders like piercing music or the
sight of great works of art. The mother-spirit,
which has brooded for centuries over
this world—the passion to foster and protect
and train—shone white and large in
her face. She was that fair impersonation
men call the Goddess of Liberty, holding
the outcast to her breast. She was Mother
Mary, with a reminder of the Heavenly
Infant in her arms.</p>

<p>No one remonstrated or spoke a word to
her as she moved from the room.</p>

<p>Becky Inchbald, pulling her shaker over
her face, went out and mounted her horse.</p>

<p>America was at the top of the stairs when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
she heard Ross Carr speak hoarsely at the
foot. She stood looking at him over the
balustrade. The baby was quiet.</p>

<p>“One word, America!—It’s all over—between
us?”</p>

<p>He could hear his watch ticking; and
outdoor sounds buzzed in his ears.</p>

<p>“No,” answered America. “It is not
all over between us.”</p>

<p>Ross Carr dropped his groping hand on
the stair newel, his next sentence also coming
in fragments.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any use—Shall I
come here—for the ceremony—next
Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Thursday,” spoke the low, slow voice
above him, “at two o’clock, was the time we
set.”</p>

<p>The culprit lifted his eyes to her and exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“America, tell me what you want me to
do!”</p>

<p>“I want you,” she said, “to be a father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
to your child!” Her mouth struggled.
She flung out the rest in a wail—“and
never speak to me of this again!”</p>

<p>Not fit to prostrate himself before her virgin
motherhood, the tarnished man hid his
face on his arm against the stair-rail. She
carried his child out of sight.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a negro on the plantation
who did not know what had happened
when Ross Carr staggered out of the house
and passed his chafing horse and the groom
as if he had forgotten his own property.</p>

<p>Baseless mountains which had been piling
lucent peak over peak, now seemed to sink
in smoke to the effacement of the sun.
Stretches of forest and road, plantation and
dimpled hill, from horizon to horizon, ceased
smiling; for the day’s heat was about to
pass off in drenching rain.</p>

<p>This cloudy interval before the thunder-burst
was just the time for stealing corn to
roast at the quarters in the evening. So
Peachy crept on all fours down narrow avenues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to avoid agitating the corntops, such
telltales are the tassel fingers. His sack
already bulged; but unexpectedly he came
against a man stretched out in the dirt face
downward—Miss Ma’ky’s Mist’ Ross
Carr!</p>

<p>Peachy backed away from the spectacle,
the grinding of teeth and the swelling of
veins on a man’s neck! Not until many
cornstalks screened him had Peachy the
courage to burst recklessly down a slim alley,
spilling his stolen ears, while corn leaves
slashed his face with their edged sabres.
The superstitious African instinctively fled
from anguish so dumb and dreadful.</p>

<p>While the county was shocked by America
Poynton’s adoption of Ross Carr’s child,
her beauty as a bride softened all critics.
She went to live with her husband on her
plantation, and there the baby grew into
robust and happy boyhood. Reticence on
the subject of Becky Inchbald was diffused
through her small world. At that date a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
small world held all the acts of many
lives.</p>

<p>Even Miss Sally Vandewater, swelling
her visiting list with another hospitable home,
grew into complete harmony with the judge’s
wife on this delicate subject.</p>

<p>Becky Inchbald went on a long visit to
Tennessee. News came back that she had
married there; and in the course of years
that she had died.</p>

<p>So far as human knowledge goes, Ross
Carr’s wife took no shrewish revenge,
though a woman of her nature must have
suffered from the blot. She always spoke
of his son as “our eldest boy,” and he grew
up among brothers and sisters without noting
that he was part alien, until some neighbor
dropped the fact in his ear. Personally he
was much like his father, whose sin matured
its bitterest fruit when that child threw himself
on the ground to sob in secret agony
because the beautiful and tender woman he
loved with such devotion was really not his
mother.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE FAIRFIELD POET</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1881</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tragedy</span>, which is never far from the
most prosperous lives, continually trod upon
the tenderest-hearted woman in Fairfield.
She hated Fairfield as a background to her
existence, but there had fate nailed her for
life. It was the forlornest of Indiana railroad
stations, looking like a scar on the face
of a beautifully wooded country, peopled by
the descendants of poor white Carolinians
and Tennesseeans. The male portion of the
community sat on the railroad platform in
yellow jeans, sprawling their naked toes to
the sun, whittling, and jetting with the regularity
of fountains upon the meerschaum-colored
boards. The women might have
lived lives of primitive simplicity, dignified
by child-bearing and neighborly sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
with one another; but they stained their
human kindness with trivial disagreements.</p>

<p>This one among them all felt the progress
of the age tearing her heartstrings out while
her circumstances kept her at a standstill.
I do not say her life would have been more
symmetrical or her experience richer if she
had lived in the whirl. She was a plain,
ground-loving woman who enjoyed the companionship
of her fruit-trees and flowers, and
worked with her hands. Indeed, crowds
annoyed her, and she was undecided what
toilets ought to be made for a large public.
The striped silk dresses of her prosperous
days, the fringed crape shawls and gimp-edged
mantillas, agreed ill with bonnets of
the passing season, and she had more respect
for what was rich and old than for new inventions.
But she was fiercely ambitious
for her children, especially her eldest son,
and for him in spite of his misfortune.
The younger boy and girl were still leaping
like colts upon their few remaining acres,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
sound in limb and wind, with the hopes of
a future sheathed in their healthy present,
when Willie was tall as a man, and far up
in his teens.</p>

<p>His mother had a picture of him taken
when he was going to school in Cincinnati,
under his uncle’s care. At that time his
auburn curls were unshorn, and he was
beautiful.</p>

<p>A few days before cottons took their terrific
rise during the civil war, Mr. Harbison
had stocked in thousands of yards. Those
were Fairfield’s best days, and he kept a
general store, making money so rapidly that
the lazy people around him felt helplessly
injured. He began his fine brick house,
building on a generous and artistic plan, at
the edge of Fairfield, where he could surround
himself with fruit-trees, and have
fields for his cattle. Whether it is a more
distinct misery to build the temple of your
home and see someone else inhabit it, or to
shelter yourself for years in a house you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
have not the power of finishing, the latter
fate was reserved for the Harbisons. With
a crash they came down from what had been
Fairfield’s opulence nearly to a level with
Fairfield’s poverty. They kept the house
and grounds and a meadow, but under such
weight of mortgages that it was comparatively
no grief at all to see the ornamental
cornices lying around the partly plastered
parlors, balustrades and newel-post standing
on end beside the skeleton stairway, and to
find the bathroom useless except as a rubbish
closet. The man who had employed
half of Fairfield was now obliged to become
himself an employee, and the general verdict
of the world against those who fail was emphasized
by communistic envy.</p>

<p>But the habit of being a woman of consideration
is not easily forgotten. Mrs. Harbison
still made the village respect her. She had
something to give to the poorest. She was
the wife of a man who had made a fortune
before he lost it, and sat in the state Senate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
More than all, she had her children, the eldest
of them a continual surprise to her. He
seemed born to stir her pride and tenderness
to their depths. He was tall, fair, and
Roman-featured, shy as a girl toward every
one but his mother, and so ravenous in
mind that he was partly through college
when his father’s reverses brought him
home.</p>

<p>Then he was seized with a spotted fever,
and approached the next world so close that
he left part of his faculties there, and was
never the same Willie he had been before.
He could hear nothing, and seldom spoke an
audible word—Mrs. Harbison’s boy, who
was made to take the world by storm—and
what had been the shyness of a country-bred
youth became the set-apart seclusion of a
hoofed and goat-eared faun. Willie Harbison
was to be seen whirring as noiseless as a
bat upon his bicycle across the open ground
at dusk. He was met coming from the
woods, silent as an Indian, and his eyes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
on everything in earth or sky except the
human beings just before him.</p>

<p>Whatever were the faults of Fairfield, it
loved and respected Willie Harbison, and
humored his self-withdrawal. And he loved
Fairfield with a partiality which saw mere
picturesqueness in the row of whittling men,
and various forms of motherhood or sisterhood
in the women. He would dismount from
his wheel to let the boys tilt with it at the
old warehouse. He loved the woods; he
loved Wild-cat and Kitten creeks, which
ploughed rock-bedded channels through the
woods; and what joy in life he fished out of
those waters only Willie himself knew. He
loved to watch from the mill, on a clear
morning, that plume of steam the south-bound
train sent around the curve, to watch another
plume roll over the first, and finally to see the
train stand suddenly on the summit of the
grade, sharp-cut against the sky. All common
life was pleasant to him. Who but his
mother could be witness that a double nature
dwelt under his floury mill clothes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Willie worked in the mill with his father,
where the roar of grinding and bolting and
the whir of belts made silent liveliness
around him. This had been bitterness to
his mother—her Willie should work with
his head alone; but she accepted it as the
result of his physical misfortune.</p>

<p>The parlors were Willie’s workshop, in
which he sawed, hammered, and glued, or
put noiseless inventions together. A carpenter’s
bench was set before two uncased
windows, and his father’s old store desk had
fallen to his unmercantile use. Its lock
was never opened unless Willie had something
which he could force himself to show
to his mother. That ripe instant arriving,
he sought her in her kitchen, her garden, or
at her spinning-wheel upstairs, and seized
her by the hand. She went with him to the
parlors, they fastened the doors, Willie
undid his desk, and placed his paper in her
fingers. The paper itself was sometimes
brown, sometimes the blue cap left from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
store, sometimes gilt-edged note having penciled
landscapes along the margins, or the
flowers he rhymed of done in water-colors;
for his hand was as skillful as his eye was
discerning. The poems were usually short,
and sensitive in rhyme and rhythm. Willie’s
themes were the common sights and the
common pathos or humor of the situations in
which he found the people around him: his
interpretation of the flicker’s feelings; his
delight in certain thick fleeces of grass; the
panorama of sky and field as it marched
across his eye; the grotesque though heartily
human family party made by old man
Persons and his wife, where half of their
descendants, unable to get into the small
house, sat on the fence while the rest ate
dinner. Willie was deaf, but he had inward
music. Every smooth and liquid
stanza was like wine to his mother. She
compared his poems to Burns’s, and could
not find the “Mountain Daisy” a whit better
than her poet’s song about the woods in
frost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Even Mr. Harbison thought well of
Willie’s performances. They were smuggled
to him by the mother, and carefully
returned to their place when the poet was
out of the house. Mr. Harbison knew all
that was going on in the world. A dozen
times a year he left the grinding of the mill
to meet his old chums at the capital, or to
quicken the action of his blood in Chicago.
A couple of stimulating days tinctured and
made endurable his month of mill work.
A man of luxurious tastes cannot lose his
tastes with his means. He was a judge of
poets, and said Willie might as well take to
poetry as to anything, for business did not
pay a man of sound faculties in these days.</p>

<p>The hum of bees could be heard all
around this unfinished brick house growing
mossy at the gables, and its shadow was long
on the afternoon sunshine. It was that
alert and happy time of year when the
earth’s sap starts new from winter distillation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>You could hear the voices of children
calling in play as they loitered home from
school; the days were so long that the cows
would not come up the pasture until nearly
seven o’clock.</p>

<p>Willie trudged across lots to supper.
Mrs. Harbison met him at the north side of
the house, having her garden knife and rake
in her hands. She put them on the stepless
front-door sill, which had never been
and never would be pressed by the foot of
an arriving guest. This stone sill was high
enough for a seat, and she sat down, tilting
her sunbonnet back, and smiling at
Willie. He was floured from head to foot.
Little of his boyish beauty except its clear
innocence remained to him. His nose was
large for his head, and on his head the auburn
curls were shorn to a thin crisping
layer.</p>

<p>His young sister was putting supper on
the table in the dining-room, his brother was
fisting with another boy on the railroad, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
up the cow lane came his father with the slow
step and somewhat of the ponderous white
presence of the walking statue in “Don Giovanni.”
But closest knit of all this family,
mother and son talked together in silence,
some birds in the mulberry-tree over their
heads making the only calling and replying
that could be heard. Before Willie reached
her, he held up his hands and signed in the
deaf-mute language:—</p>

<p>“The preacher has come back.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harbison raised her hands and
darted her fingers into various shapes, saying
thereby, “Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“No,” Willie replied as swiftly; “I only
saw his coffin in the wagon, and Nancy
Ellen sitting beside it. She had to bring
him the whole twenty miles from where he
died, in a wagon.”</p>

<p>“Because it wasn’t on a railroad?”</p>

<p>Willie nodded.</p>

<p>His mother wove on: “Poor Nancy Ellen!
Her father wouldn’t let her have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
preacher for so long, and turned her off
when she did marry him. Now she’s a
widow in her honeymoon, and old man Morton
saying he told her a preacher as old as
himself wasn’t any match for her. Did you
see her father? How did he act?”</p>

<p>“He got into the wagon by the driver,”
said Willie’s fingers.</p>

<p>“Well, that was something for him.”</p>

<p>“And they drove to his place.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he’ll let her come back and
live at home now.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had seen Nancy Ellen.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see her after the milking
is done.”</p>

<p>“Seen her by the preacher,” insisted
Willie’s passes. “She looked like a captive
coming in chains to Rome.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be bound she did. Every jolt
of that twenty miles is stamped in <i>her</i> mind.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” flashed Willie, “I knew what
the preacher sung to himself all along the
road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“What a notion! You’ll have to fix it
up in poetry now, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Willie shook his head many times and
reddened.</p>

<p>“You said the preacher used to sing
home from meeting in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” affirmed Mrs. Harbison.
“And Nancy Ellen used to listen for him to
go by their place.”</p>

<p>Their talk paused, and Willie looked up
at the birds in the mulberry. Having afterward
caught his mother’s eye, he wove out
slowly:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“When in the tree above his head</div>
<div class="indent">The sap goes tingling through the bark,</div>
<div class="verse">She will remember it was dead,</div>
<div class="indent">And hear him singing in the dark.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Oh, Willie, is that the first verse or the
last? Have you written it down?”</p>

<p>Willie smiled shyly, putting his head
down toward one shoulder, without making
any reply. His mother urged, with eager
fingers:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Print it in some place when you get
it done. Nancy Ellen would be pleased.”</p>

<p>“I’m not an obituary poet,” wove Willie.</p>

<p>“But that’s so good.” Mrs. Harbison
moved her lips, repeating it to herself.
“And ain’t you ever going to publish anything
you write? I’ve heard of people getting
money for it.”</p>

<p>Willie uttered a gentle sneer. He laughed
at his mother in a way that always made her
laugh with him.</p>

<p>“But if you would let your father fix up
your writings,” she continued, repeating an
old plea, “and send them to some publishing
house, I know they would put them in a
book for you.”</p>

<p>The gate, weighted by a stone, slammed
to behind his father coming to the evening
meal. But before his mother rose, Willie
found time to make dance before her eyes
the characters indicating this promise:—</p>

<p>“Some day I’ll get on my bicycle and
ride and ride until I come to a publisher.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
If you miss me, you’ll know where I’ve
gone. You can just say to yourself, ‘He’s
off having his poems published.’ Wait till
then, mother; that will be soon enough.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never do it,” said his mother,
having no idea how near the time was.</p>

<p>She gave her family their supper and
helped to milk the cows. She thought of
Willie’s stanza when the milk first sang in
the pail, and kept repeating it until the rising
froth drowned all sounds of the lashing
streams quite at her pail’s brim.</p>

<p>When the house was tidy and full of twilight
stillness, Mrs. Harbison put on a clean
apron and took her sunbonnet to make her
call of condolence. It was likely they would
want watchers at Morton’s, and she was
ready to do anything. She had helped bear
the burden of life and death so long in Fairfield
that illness, a new baby, or the mysterious
breathless presence in any house was a
peremptory invitation to her.</p>

<p>The boys were playing hide-and-seek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
around the warehouse, and as she crossed the
open lot she saw the usual line of wise men
sitting on the edge of the platform with their
legs across the rail, as if they had all agreed
to make an offering of their feet to the Juggernaut
of the next passing train.</p>

<p>Willie darted like a bat or a night bird
on his bicycle far up and far down the
smooth wagon road. Now he took a turn,
and came spinning among the boys, scattering
them before him, and escaping as often
as they chased him. In one of these excursions
he crossed his mother’s way.</p>

<p>The last red streaks and high sunset lights
were not gone out of the sky. She lifted up
her hands and spelled, “Are you starting
out to hunt a publisher now?”</p>

<p>And Willie laughed and nodded and
made her a sign of good-by.</p>

<p>The pleasant stillness of the evening fell
around her like a blessing as she went on.
Fireflies were filling one field, as if a conflagration
under that particular ground sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
up endless streams of sparks. She smelled
the budding elders, and was reminded of tile-like
bits in her past, fitted oddly together.</p>

<p>Morton lived but a few steps beyond the
village. She had been talking a mere moment
with Nancy Ellen, and had not yet
entered the room where the preacher lay
when another neighbor came in with excitement,
and said aloud, over the whispered
talk of the mourning house, that something
was wrong down at the station.</p>

<p>“That express has run into something
again,” proclaimed the neighbor, “and looks,
by the way folks run, as if it wasn’t a cow
this time. Enough cows and pigs has been
killed by that railroad.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen the express,” said Mrs.
Harbison, feeling her head full of wheels.
“It was all quiet when I was there a minute
ago.”</p>

<p>“The express has stopped. Good reason!
There’s something on the track, I tell ye,”
insisted the neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Willie’s mother was sure it could not be
Willie. He was conscious of his infirmity,
and so cautious that she had long ceased to
be anxious about him. He knew the times
of all the trains with nice exactness, also.
Yet she started from the house without
speaking another word, and ran until she
reached the crowd.</p>

<p>The engine stood hissing; it confronted
her with the glare of its eye, a horrid and
remorseless fate, ready to go its way with
bell-clanging and all cheerful noise, no
matter who had been ground under its
wheels.</p>

<p>The conductor was just stepping on board,
for time and orders wait for nothing. The
engineer had already climbed back to his
cab; he saw a running woman kneel down
on the platform and draw the boy up from
the boards to rest in her arms. Having
seen that much, the engineer turned away
his head and wept out loud; and the train
moved on, bearing pale faces that looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
backward as long as they could discern anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harbison had stumbled over Willie’s
bent wheel first. When she found him indeed
laid in the midst of the crowd, she did
not believe it. He was not mangled. His
bones were sound—she felt them with a
fiercely quick hand. There was no mark
about him excepting a dirty-looking spot on
one temple.</p>

<p>“Willie,” she cried, shaking him.
“Willie! Willie!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to carry him home,” said
her husband at her side, his voice sounding
far off as if it came strained through some
dense medium.</p>

<p>She looked up, and could not understand
it.</p>

<p>“He’s knocked senseless,” she claimed.
“Why doesn’t somebody bring water?”</p>

<p>“He never knowed what hurt him,” cautiously
said one villager to another. “The
train was goin’ so fast, and he come up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
among the houses onto it so fast, that it was
done in a flash.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t never want to see no better
boy than Willie Harbison was,” responded
the other.</p>

<p>But only his mother—when she had him
at home lying in that pomp of death with
which we all shall impress beholders—could
have pronounced the true oration over him.
Through her dumb tragedy she wanted to
make deaf-mute signs to some intelligence
that here lay one of Nature’s poets, with a
gift virgin and untarnished.</p>

<p>He had never hunted a public. His public
was the woods and sky, and his critic
one fond woman. Not a line of unsatisfied
ambition marked his placid face. He had
lived an humble, happy life, and sung for the
sake of expression, not for the sake of praise.
He had, after all, only gone to find the best
publisher, and his mother could always hear
him “singing in the dark.”</p>

In the glass I frequently see a juvenile
face with dimples around the mouth,
that disowns its thirty years.</p>

<p>“You think,” said Julian, after kissing
me in a way which would scandalize some
of the girls who made the best matches,
“that we can’t raise the money.”</p>

<p>Such a thought would have been justified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
by the fact that we seldom could raise the
money.</p>

<p>“But we can. And what’s the use of
waiting around till we are old? I’m in
my thirties. And if I ever do anything
now’s the time to do it. A man can’t
make a success of painting here in the
west.”</p>

<p>I looked all around Julian’s studio. He
had done many portraits, and hated them.
They made our living. But he believed he
was wasting time.</p>

<p>I always loved to be in the studio, and
sometimes sat there a whole afternoon, with
bits of sewing, behind a screen. A great
many people took the elevator to explore
Julian’s work place. He had reputation in
his native city. And when they stumbled
around the screen on me, they might have
taken me for a model. But most of the
explorers were country people, piloted by
their town friends to see the sights. I only
looked odd to them. I know I looked odd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
because Julian had me dress in loose gowns
and broad hats. Cheese cloth is only four
cents a yard and very wide, and with borders
of velvet or lace it made sumptuous
cool toilets. I was slim; and a dull blue
gown, belted just under my arms and puffed
at the shoulders, with an aureole of dull
blue hat over it, made me look nice in
Julian’s eyes or I never should have had
the courage to face the street. When a
person is slim and lithe, however, her daring
clothes have not the aggressive grossness of
a fat woman’s daring clothes.</p>

<p>Looking around the painting-room, I could
not think Julian a failure. He had made
it so pretty with tiles and pottery and draping
stuff, and flowers painted in dull red
or bronze vases, or in masses wasting their
petals, and landscapes, some blurred so you
had to squint your eyes to get the outlines.
Looking at himself I always considered him
a great success. His mouth and chin were
so refined. He was muscular and alert in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
his carriage for a man of his profession, and
his ideas were far grander than mine.</p>

<p>“So I’m going to sell the little farm,”
said Julian.</p>

<p>“Oh!” I exclaimed, “that’s all the property
we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you were perfectly
willing. What does it amount to, anyhow?
Fifteen acres and a scrubby house and
barn.”</p>

<p>“What will old Lena do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll continue her gardening. I’ve
had an offer of two thousand dollars for it.
One thousand down, five hundred in one
year, and the balance in eighteen months.
We can live a long time abroad on that.
And I shall get hold of something then.
We’ll never come back here.”</p>

<p>I did not mind that at all. The prospect
was dazzling. But I saw I should have to
tell him at once.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know your poor painter
would take you to Europe, did you? Think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
of Rome, think of Paris, think of being
domesticated in some ancient German city
while I paint!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think of it, Julian; but could you
go without me?”</p>

<p>“Could I go without you?” said Julian,
setting me off on the tip of his knees. “Did
I ever go to any place without you? Didn’t
I manage that jaunt up to Canada with you?
Did I scour out to Colorado and leave you
at home? Do you <i>want</i> me to go without
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Then what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You certainly don’t know,” said Julian
severely, “if you think I would go off to
Europe for even a limited time, to say nothing
of an indefinite time, without <i>you</i>.
Why, you great baby, you’d cry your eyes
out! And if you got sick who would do you
up in packs and give you your medicine?
You can’t get along away from me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“I know it, Julian.”</p>

<p>“And where would you stay!” continued
Julian with increasing indignation.
“You wouldn’t want to keep up a house,
and you wouldn’t want to board. And
what business would you have over here by
yourself, anyhow! You provoke me!”</p>

<p>“I believe I’m going to cry,” I said.</p>

<p>“I should think you would, for proposing
such a thing. But don’t do it.”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> going to cry,” I affirmed, and put
my hands up to my face, while I quivered
all over. These mute fits of sobbing, relics
of my babyhood which I try so hard to outgrow,
seize me unreasonably. They take
away every scrap of dignity. I never could
get the best end of a quarrel on account of
this weakness; for who could sweep out of
a room with a stinging retort, when at the
door she was sure to break down, lay her
cheek against the frame, and sob until every
fibre in her seemed melting!</p>

<p>The only good effect of my crying, besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the delicious languor it left over me, was
that it melted Julian also. I have known
it to be a very convenient solvent when he
hardened himself into a male tyrant. His
face was sure to relax and his motherly
arms to gather me in. Some men will run
from tears, and very disagreeable men they
are. Julian seems to like the soaking. It
is tribute to him as a man, and certifies
to his grip on my individuality. He is convinced
I am very fond of him, and dependent
on his gracious favor, when I creep to
his knees to cry.</p>

<p>Julian wiped my tears and comforted me
upon his shoulder, his face assuming its
usual superior expression.</p>

<p>When I got my breath and knew that I
could talk becomingly between little hiccoughs,
I told him the message I had from
T’férgore, and he saw at once how it would
prevent the European trip.</p>

<p>He whistled a minute, and we studied
each other’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Well,” said Julian, “I suppose we owe
everything to the old fellow, and if he is
really coming we’ll have to prepare for
him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we better go out to the little
farm,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we better. We’ll have
to economize, to gratify all his fastidious
tastes.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d sent word to you, instead
of to me,” I burst out. “It’s your relation
this time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I wish he had,” said Julian, smiling.</p>

<p>“Are you glad or sorry, Julian?”</p>

<p>“Glad, of course. But why didn’t you
tell me before?”</p>

<p>“How could I tell you what I didn’t
know myself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s his fault, evidently,” said Julian.</p>

<p>I began to wonder if Julian would not be
a little jealous of T’férgore. As I had never
seen T’férgore myself, I did not know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
his aptitude might be at putting himself
forward and eclipsing the master of the
house. But I was glad it was Julian’s relation
this time.</p>

<p>We had had several of my kin living
upon our hearthstone at various times, and
though Julian was always kind, I think he
undervalued the stock from which I sprung.
He said I must have been changed in the
cradle, for refinement was my natural atmosphere.
I did myself feel a creeping of the
flesh at brother Jack’s ways; but the dear
boy had been brought up away from me, and
his manners were not his fault. He had an
affectionate and honorable nature, and soon
quit spitting upon our Brussels rugs and
hard finished floors; his English, however,
was beyond all help. I loved Jack so dearly
that it was a grief to me to see him falling
to pieces in his clothes, and slipping up and
down in shoes that were never buttoned.
He frequently put his trousers on wrong
side foremost, and came to me to help him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
hunt the pockets. With my own pin-money
I bought him hats that must adorn his rosy
face, but after he slouched out in them once
they looked disreputable. His coat-sleeves
hung over his dirty fists like a hackman’s.
Whenever he passed through his room he
left it as if it had been struck by a tornado.
The earth adhered to Jack. Stray burrs
and dumpings of gravel appeared by the
chair where he sat to put on his slippers.
He had no cattish horror of mud, and left
the print of his foot on his napkin under
the table. When Jack was partially dressed,
he shouted for me, to the remotest corners, to
come and button his sleeves and hand him
his tie.</p>

<p>The more fastidious our company, the
louder would Jack bite his nails, while he
sprawled like a spread eagle on the sofa,
until every pause in conversation became
vocal with that horrible cracking. He lost
everything portable which was not tied or
buttoned about his person, but he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
always so good-natured about the losses it
seemed stingy to regret the money it cost to
replace things.</p>

<p>As he had no inclination toward Art, and
walked flat-footed over canvases whenever
he came into the studio, Julian got him
employment. Jack’s apprenticeship to buying
and selling was to me a long period of
alternate hopes and despairs. He would
begin well, and in fancy I saw him a merchant
prince; but eventually he fell out
with everybody and thought himself abused
when his employer objected to his dribbling
small change along the streets, and losing
keys. I did not know what to do for Jack
when the despair seasons came upon me.
But in the end he did very well for himself.
He got tired of the city, and no cajoling of
mine could keep him from thrusting some
shirts into a valise, grasping a pair of heavy
boots in his hand, and starting for the
country, sowing handkerchiefs and unmated
socks in his wake. He went to work for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
middle-aged widow with considerable property,
and she got the dear boy’s consent to
marry him: so there he is, a landed proprietor,
with a thrifty wife to button his
sleeves and join knives with him in the butter.
Our bric-à-brac ways trouble him no
more, and what he loses in the furrow at
planting time he may find again during harvest.
And when he comes to see us, his
loving heart is as mellow as the apples he
brings.</p>

<p>Then there was Aunt Lizy. I suppose
she was christened Eliza, but her name was
always pronounced Lizy with a plaintive
lingering on the <i>i</i>. We had her with us
two years. She was a stepsister of my stepmother’s.
She looked like an Indian, and
had seen more trouble than any other woman
with whom she ever measured experiences.
Her breathing was all done in sighs,
and she tweaked her nose so much it was
twisted at the end, and all of a dark red
color. She and I never could understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
why fortune hit her so hard, and we talked
about it so much that I was kept quite
bilious.</p>

<p>Aunt Lizy felt too low to sit in the parlor
unless dragged there by entreaties, and spent
a great deal of her time on the back stairs
with a sunbonnet drawn over her eyes.
She did not want to go anywhere, and the
sound of the door-bell exorcised her as if
she were a ghost. She compared her lot to
mine until I was ashamed of myself, wondering
if I had not stood in her sun.</p>

<p>I think Julian secretly regarded her as a
trying disease that we had in the house, and
that must be doctored and endured. She
was so much in awe of him that I suffered
anguish with her whenever he tried to show
a man’s bluff kindness to her.</p>

<p>Aunt Lizy finally died, and her face
looked young and cheerful in the coffin. We
scraped some money together and bought a
lot in the cemetery, and her misused body
rests there under roses, myrtle, and verbenas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
I take pains to keep her shade pleasant and
her sod well trimmed; and when the flowers
look particularly thrifty, I feel as if Aunt
Lizy were learning how to laugh, at last.</p>

<p>Her daughter, who had been deserted by
a husband as soon as she gave him a child to
support, came to the funeral, and remained
to make an unlimited visit and pick up such
wearing apparel and other comforts as we
had given Aunt Lizy.</p>

<p>She took entire possession of the house,
being as loud-voiced and self-assertive as
her mother was crushed and sensitive. But
she owned me before everybody as her
cousin, and took notice of Julian, though
she preferred Irish society in the kitchen,
and installed me as her nurse, while she enjoyed
it. The baby’s usual expression was
that of a young bird when it hears the
parent return to the nest with a full beak.
I used to sit studying the interior of the
poor child’s throat, while its voice pierced
my marrow. Julian made a sketch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
pimply little face, but finished it up with a
black cat’s body and a high fence. It cried
steadily during its stay, and had the croup
and the doctor and our sleep, until Julian
said he must follow the excusable example
of its father and abandon it. He paid the
fare of Aunt Lizy’s daughter to relations in
the far west, and loaded her with whatever
she fancied her mother’s. Yet she probably
thought we shirked kinsmen’s duty toward
her, for we have since heard the whisper
that we got all that Aunt Lizy ought to
have left her.</p>

<p>So I was glad that T’férgore and not one
of my own stock now dictated a postponement
of the foreign trip.</p>

<p>Next day we drove out to the little farm
and saw old Lena. Julian declared she was
worth driving the five miles to see, if it was
only to say “Good-day, Lena,” and watch
her shriveled smiles. She always wore a
blue calico or blue woolen dress, low shoes,
and scarlet stockings. Her gait was a cheerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
trot, but her tongue was lamest at the
English language of any tongue I have ever
heard. She had a grandson named Fritz,
tallow-colored and blue-eyed, and covered
with contagious smiles. He never had forgotten
the feeling of wooden shoes on his
feet, and clumped conscientiously in leather.
Lena and Fritz rented the little farm, and
Fritz pushed the vegetables, fruit, and butter
to market in a hand-cart. Summer or
winter, the road, a turnpike, was as smooth
and hard as a floor. Every inch of the
fifteen acres was under cultivation. Such
weeds as were allowed to grow had some
medicinal property, or were good for feeding
Lena’s birds. She had her cages hung
along the porch, the two canaries, the red-bird,
and the mockingbird trying to out-sing
and out-chatter the wild things in the cherry-trees.</p>

<p>It was the last of May, and I snuffed
delightful odors from the little farm. Nasturtium
vines were already running up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
strings at the window. They produced little
pods of which Lena made my favorite
pickles. She had one blazing bed of tulips
in the garden, and her early vegetables were
showing green. Everything Lena tended
grew like magic. Fritz had raked every
stick and bit of trash into the meadow, and
the heap was burning with a pale flicker in
the sunlight, and raising smoke like incense
from the sod. Whenever I smell that smoke
I think I must tell my sensations to somebody
who can put them in a poem: a
homely poem about last year’s pea-vines and
strawberry and currant leaves, exhaling the
dew as they turned into blue vapor, and
suggesting, though I cannot tell why, the
old home garden life when Adam and Eve
were content to lean down to the sweet
ground and feel the loam with their fingers,
or take delight in the breath of fresh-cut
grass.</p>

<p>The walk up to the porch was of uneven
stones, each outlined by moss. Lena arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
between two gaping cellar doors at the side
of the house, and ambled down the walk to
meet us.</p>

<p>“Wie befinden, Lena?” said Julian.
“Suppose we put off that sale and you take
us to live on your prospective estate?”</p>

<p>“Was Lena going to buy it?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Of course. She’s grown so wealthy off
my land that she was going to turn me away
entirely.”</p>

<p>Lena laughed and shook her head and
made gestures of good-will.</p>

<p>We went into the house, and Julian
bargained with Lena to take us home unto
our estate. There was plenty of room for
our furniture. Lena had nothing but a
spinning-wheel in one long slant-sided room
over the wing. Julian said he should leave
the spinning-wheel alone, hang his draperies
and pictures there, set up his easels, and
make it a painting-room. The house had
all sorts of tags and after-thoughts built to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
the main part. Some boards in the floors
arched downwards like inverted rainbows.
You mounted two steps to one room and
descended three to another. There were
tall mantles and unexpected closets. The
staircase twisted in a way I fancied T’férgore
would not like. I sat down on the
porch bench while Julian was giving Lena
directions, and tried to picture T’férgore
coming up the walk toward the house. Was
he white or brown? Would he be churlish
or full of the spirit of laughter? Was he
bringing trouble or gladness to Julian and
me?</p>

<p>It took several weeks for us to get quite
comfortably settled at the little farm. We
lazily decorated our residence, or suspended
labor upon it, just as we pleased. Then the
delicious June days trod upon each other’s
heels. It seemed as if I had scarcely risen
and found the breakfast Lena always kept
for me—of toast and jelly and chocolate—before
the evening star trembled in the west,
and I was following her and Fritz to the
barnyard to take my cup of new milk with
the foam on. Even Midsummer Day, the
longest and loveliest day in the year, was
gone while we talked about it.</p>

<p>At first our friends came down from the
city, but as the heat increased they took
longer journeys. Julian painted zealously.
He said after T’férgore came he would be
hindered a great deal. I lay in a hammock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
and watched him, sometimes wondering at
my new languor. I thought a great deal
about T’férgore, without talking of him to
Julian. Julian licensed me to be silly to a
certain extent: beyond that limit I kept my
silliness to myself. It was nothing for me
to twist Mr. Fergus Dering’s name into
T’férgore, because I had a talent for rechristening
people and objects. But how
impatient Julian would have been with all
my speculations about T’férgore! I could
not make an image of him in my mind, yet
he was always haunting me. I wondered if
he would stay with us always; sometimes
his ideal head, with impalpable garments
below it, changing from expression to expression,
laughed at me from the clouds.
What an individuality he must have to seize
upon me so before his coming! He was a
gifted creature, according to Julian; and his
silent approach was weaving me in a network
of fascination that I never thought at
first of resisting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>When I was roused to activity, we made
haste to finish our arrangements about the
house and get T’férgore’s room ready. Julian
himself hung some draping stuff from the
studio there. We spent money on a bath,
and a curious water jug and basin, and I
could not feel contented without giving the
chamber a more delicate look with muslin
and blue silesia. We used to stand looking
around this apartment with admiration.
Julian hung one of his flower pictures there,
though he said T’férgore would probably do
nothing but make a face at it. And I never
went into the woods for a handful of wild
flowers, without filling T’férgore’s vase of
Dresden china, when I got back.</p>

<p>Then Julian said we must have a horse
and vehicle, for if he knew anything about
T’férgore that young gentleman would want
to take the air on wheels. We had, however,
very little cash to spend on such a
turnout.</p>

<p>“We can dispense with style,” said Julian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
“if a kind, serviceable rig is to be bought
cheap.”</p>

<p>So he kept a liveryman in town on the
lookout for him, and one afternoon he received
a message and went to drive home
our bargain.</p>

<p>Lena followed me to the gate to see the
flourish Julian described there before alighting.</p>

<p>“What made you get a cart?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“This,” said Julian, “is a sort of a dog-cart.
The rage is all for dog-carts just now,
and we couldn’t have a phaeton, you know.”</p>

<p>“But they aren’t painted red.”</p>

<p>“This one is,” said Julian.</p>

<p>“And there is no place behind for the
dogs,” I further objected.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, T’férgore won’t want to carry a
dog,” said Julian. “It’s a bargain on two
wheels!”</p>

<p>Whatever is mine acquires peculiar merits
in my eyes. A halo of possession arches it,
making it a little better than the same thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
owned by anybody else. I accepted the red
cart and followed Julian into the stable-yard,
where, after Fritz helped him unhitch, he
showed me the points of the horse.</p>

<p>“Women always notice the ornamental
part of a turnout first,” said Julian. “Before
you looked at the cart you ought to
have taken in Leander.”</p>

<p>“Is his name Leander?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“So I have been informed,” replied
Julian.</p>

<p>“What makes him look as if he were
crying?”</p>

<p>“His eyes need sponging,” said Julian.
“This warm weather is severe on a horse’s
eyes.”</p>

<p>“I hope he has not parted with any near
and dear friend.” “He looks as if he could
hardly stand up under some affliction.”</p>

<p>“Horses are dear now,” observed Julian
with severity, “and you can’t expect to get
a thoroughbred for forty dollars. The liveryman
said he shipped a car-load to Louisville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
last week, some of them so weak they had to
lean against the sides of the car. This one
is sound, and only needs a little good care to
bring him out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, his bones all look nice,” I assented.
My heart began to warm toward Leander.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine thing to own a noble animal
like a horse, isn’t it, Julian?—and to see
him grazing around one’s homestead.”</p>

<p>Julian said he believed he would take
Leander into the yard and let him clip off
some of the grass, before stabling him.</p>

<p>Fritz put the red cart under a shed, and
helped Lena milk, while we walked enamored
after our purchase from one part of
the lawn to another.</p>

<p>“What makes his hams look so sad,
Julian?” I inquired with concern.</p>

<p>“Flanks, you mean,” said Julian.</p>

<p>“Yes. But aren’t horses usually cushiony
there?”</p>

<p>“Pigs and prize cattle are,” said Julian
contemptuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“But his hind legs run up so tall that
when he lifts one he seems to be coming in
two, like Baron Munchausen’s horse when it
got caught in the city gates.”</p>

<p>“Sorry you don’t like him,” observed
Julian, scratching a match on his heel and
lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>“I do like him, Julian. It would be
strange if I didn’t like our own horse! The
way he is standing now doesn’t show his
ribs so. Couldn’t we induce him to keep
that position generally?”</p>

<p>But Leander now drew all his feet nearer
to a focus, and frightened me by a convulsion.</p>

<p>“He’s just going to lie down,” explained
Julian. “He wants to roll in the grass.
They say a horse that rolls clear over is
worth fifty dollars, anyhow. Watch him,
now.”</p>

<p>We watched him in breathless suspense,
Julian holding the lighted cigar away from
his lips. Leander, after several half revolutions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
brandished his heels triumphantly in
the air and rolled clear over.</p>

<p>Julian and I shook hands.</p>

<p>“Gained ten dollars in value since I
brought him home,” said Julian.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts I had harbored about
an artist’s knowledge of horses certainly
vanished. And Leander, after standing up
to shake himself, lay down to try it again.
But this time he brandished ineffectual heels
and contented himself with only a half turn.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he has gone off any in
his value, Julian?” I inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Julian, throwing out
clouds of smoke. “You mustn’t expect too
much of a horse on a couple of mouthfuls of
grass.”</p>

<p>We drove Leander a great deal during
the July weather. The cart had very easy
springs, and I liked billowing along on them,
though the motion was a little jerky. Leander
was a kind creature. He never kicked,
though he sometimes got his legs tangled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
his tackling, fighting flies; and notwithstanding
his countenance continued watery, he
took a widow-like interest in us. I fed him
lumps of sugar and bunches of very sweet
grass, which he swallowed in a resigned way.
Julian, with sleeves rolled up, zealously
mixed chopped feed for him, and Leander
smeared this from sunken temple to sunken
jaw, so that often when I entered the stable
I thought he was undergoing a poulticing.</p>

<p>Leander objected to railway trains, so we
knew he had spirit.</p>

<p>“There’s considerable go in him,” said
Julian as we trotted between fence-rows
where elderberries were spreading and ripening.
“Wait till I get him fat once!
You’ll be astonished to see how he comes
out.”</p>

<p>“Do you think his eyes will quit weeping
as his condition improves, Julian?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Naturally. We can get him glasses if
they don’t,” said Julian. “What an absurd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
baby you are in your demands! Beauty
and muscle never go together in a horse.
Some of the best goers on the turf are a
mere mass of wires when you look at them
from an æsthetic standpoint.”</p>

<p>It was really enough to have any kind of
power, except our own, trundling us along
the pleasant roads. I grew to feel no solicitude
whatever about Leander’s ribs while he
stood cooling them in the creek, and Julian
and I in the high cart watched the sunlight
come down the woods’ aisles, and long festoons
of grapevine dipping and reflecting
their leaves in water. When we met anybody
I tried complacently to imagine we
were an English farm-couple very well-to-do
and what they call smart in our turnout;
or that we were Italian peasants, basking in
the sun as we jogged royally to some festa.
But Julian became very critical on the proportions
of horses and vehicles to each other.
He ridiculed a combination of tall horse and
low phaeton, the top of which barely reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
up to the horse’s back; or of pony and
double-seated carriage, looking like a tug
drawing a steamer. In short, we were satisfied
with our own goods and chattels: and
when Julian graciously lent Lena the turnout
to go to town in, and she filled the cart
bed with ripe tomatoes and the seat with her
blue person and Fritz, its perfect adaptation
to her uses convinced me what a versatile
and valuable bargain ours was.</p>

<p>The time came for me to meet and bring
home Jennie Purdy from the Avenue station.
She had been one of my special chums
at school. I always loved women; there
seems to me something unwholesome and unsound
in the woman who proclaims that she
hates and distrusts all of her own sex. At
school I was Jennie Purdy’s easily-moulded
slave: she dictated what I should wear and
how I should conduct myself. I denied myself
many a game of croquet, when that pastime
was fresh, to sit and fan her while she
slept off some slight indisposition. And in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
return she petted and instructed me in all
the niceties of etiquette. She was half a
dozen years my senior, and at that time enjoying
a small fortune of her own; but this
was afterward lost, and she had many a
struggle before deciding upon and mastering
the profession of medicine.</p>

<p>Jennie Purdy was one of the most fastidious
creatures alive, an epicure, and unsparing
of herself as a student. Years did not age,
but rather ground her down to finer delicacy.
I felt considerable pride in her, and counted
on having her at hand when T’férgore came.
She did not lack the eccentricities which
always cluster around any woman living outside
of intimate family life. She professed
to dislike men; but I, knowing her warm
heart, knew also her self-deception. All
isolated women fall into one of two errors
about the opposite sex: they count mankind
a vast monster, to be avoided and suspected,
or a vast angel to be worshiped in secrecy
and silence; whereas, men are only good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
comfortable souls, very much like ourselves,
but made a little stouter so they can hold us
and spread out their shoulders for irrigation
when we want to cry.</p>

<p>Though Jennie Purdy held dark views of
mankind, I suspected that under the surface
she was one of the worshiping ones. Still,
I was not prepared to have her tell me, an
hour after our arrival at home, that she was
on the point of marriage.</p>

<p>We sat down in T’férgore’s room, where
I had been showing her the appointments,
and I pulled a hassock to her side, eager for
particulars. She should be married from
the little farm instead of a boarding-house,
if she could be content with such a wedding
as we could give. But I upbraided her for
keeping her secret from me, almost as seriously
as she once upbraided me for daring to
marry at all.</p>

<p>“You won’t want me to be married here,”
said Jennie, with a snap. “You’ll have too
many prejudices.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“But I always thought you were the person
with prejudices, dear,” I remonstrated,
“and that Julian and I were too unconventional
for you.”</p>

<p>“I am going to marry a divorced man,”
disclosed Jennie.</p>

<p>I caught my breath and said “Oh!”</p>

<p>“There—I knew it!” observed Jennie.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything but ‘Oh.’ What
made him get divorced?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know him,” said Jennie,
“and so you can’t judge of the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“But you might try me,” I pleaded.
“Has he been divorced a long time?”</p>

<p>“About a month,” owned my old, fastidious
chum, turning into another woman
before my very eyes. She never was pretty,
but a certain noble pride had given her a
carriage I enthusiastically admired. Now
she sat before me a dupe of her own absurd
fancies, half defiant and half apologetic.
The woman who had taught me that only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
most serious incompatibility should separate
a married pair was going to wed a man who
had been divorced one month!</p>

<p>“His wife was never a fit companion for
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” I said.</p>

<p>“An ignorant, miserable creature, who
entrapped him when he was a boy and has
kept him down in the world ever since.”</p>

<p>“It’s always the wife’s fault,” I said.</p>

<p>“People were continually asking him
how he came to marry such a woman.”</p>

<p>“And he let the question pass without
knocking down the questioner?”</p>

<p>“There never was anything fit to eat in
the house, and his clothes were never fit to
wear.”</p>

<p>“Poor dear!” I observed. “Had his
income anything to do with it?”</p>

<p>“She kept him from getting on,” expostulated
my old chum.</p>

<p>“And he brought all his grievances to
you for redress?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“I expected to meet nothing but prejudiced
opposition in you,” said Jennie. “But
of course I was bound to tell you. You cannot
say anything to alter my determination.”</p>

<p>My head whirled with this spectacle of a
sane woman suddenly gone mad over a worthless
man. Shakespeare never touched the
weakness of womankind so closely as when
he made Titania’s infatuation. The greater
the ass, the more Titania adores him.</p>

<p>“I hate such an irregular marriage!” I
said, breathing quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you do,” retorted Jennie.
“You’re the slave of society. You wouldn’t
have the courage to go against one of society’s
whims.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want that kind of courage which
tramples on decent marriage customs. And
you were the first to teach me the value
of an irreproachable standing before the
world.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy for women like you, who know
nothing of the miseries of an unequal marriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
to take a high moral stand,” said my
old chum, turning whiter always as our talk
sunk lower. I was afraid Julian would hear
us and come down from the painting-room
overhead. He never liked Jennie as heartily
as I thought it his duty to like her.
And he laughed at the little barnacles of
whims which an isolated life fastened on
her.</p>

<p>All the time I was talking to her the
fancied image of T’férgore was before my
eyes.</p>

<p>“How much more faithful will this man
be to you,” I went on, “than he was to the
woman he left one month ago? He has
somehow cast a glamour over you. I know
just how he looks—a great, whimpering,
Falstaffian baby of a thing, coarse to his
last fibre!”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Jennie.</p>

<p>“If he were not coarse would he ever allow
a woman standing related to him as wife
to be slurred to his face? Would he be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
ready to attach his mildewed life to yours
without a blemish?”</p>

<p>“I can’t hear you talk so,” said Jennie.
“You’d better let me go away. I cannot
stay in the house.”</p>

<p>“You cannot go away,” I declared fiercely.
“I understand now why parents have locked
their daughters up.”</p>

<p>“You are interfering with what does not
concern you at all,” said Jennie, trembling,
“and not in the least altering my determination.
You cannot choose my fate for
me. I have lived a lonely life year after
year. Nobody considered me. Why am
I to stand on nice points considering everybody?
He thinks I can make him happy.
I believe he will treat me kindly.”</p>

<p>“You have every warrant for believing
that,” I exclaimed, struggling to calm myself
in the fear that I was going to make a
scene.</p>

<p>“I have,” said Jennie, with a kind of
pride strange in her; “for he provided for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
the family to the full extent of his means,
before separating from them.”</p>

<p>“So he had children? And deserted
them?”</p>

<p>“Five,” replied Jennie in embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Five children! And he provided for
them by taking their father from them when
they needed a father most!”</p>

<p>“They are all boys but the youngest,”
said Jennie.</p>

<p>I knew now that I was going to make a
scene, struggle against it as I might.</p>

<p>“And is the smallest a little child yet?”</p>

<p>“Not an exceedingly little child,” said
Jennie, picking at her dress and not seeming
to see the fingers at which she stared.
“Two years old, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand about family life?
Don’t you see what a callous wretch is the
man who can abandon his own flesh and
blood? How will you ever close your eyes
in sleep again if you help him in wronging
that little child—that little child!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>I stood up from my seat and groped toward
her. The moment of my own weakness
and terror was coming.</p>

<p>Jennie took hold of me as she used to do
at school.</p>

<p>“I have spoken out to you,” I said, hanging
to her neck; “and now you must take
care of me.”</p>

<p>She saw that T’férgore was approaching
the house; and her face filled with tender
solicitude is the last thing I can recall as I
fainted.</p>


<h4>PART III<br>

THE AMBROSIAL YOUTH</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His flesh is angel’s flesh, all alive.”</p>

<p>“Honor to the house where they are simple to the
verge of hardship, so that there the intellect is awake
and reads the laws of the universe, the soul worships
truth and love, honor and courtesy flow into all deeds.”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>September weather was over the world
before I felt able to be carried out-of-doors.
I had been very ill, but at my worst I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
having Jennie on my mind, and
hanging to her hand while I pleaded over
and over the cause of the little child.</p>

<p>Now, though weak, I had reached a state
of rapturous convalescence, and reached it
quite suddenly. Julian lifted me out to the
shaded lawn, where Jennie had wadded a
rocking-chair with pillows. The leaves were
turning, but none had fallen. Lena’s birds
hanging in a row along the eaves of the
porch kept it up at a great rate, the canary
seeming to recognize me and give me the
name he had long since invented for me:
turning his head and calling through the
bars, “Maë, Maë!”</p>

<p>Lena and Fritz came around the corner of
the house and grinned. Lena had saved the
biggest pear on the dwarf tree for me, and
Fritz brought a nosegay of marigolds, strong
enough to stifle many invalids. “It’s quite
like a Harvest Home,” said Julian. “We
ought to strap a corn-shock on Leander’s
back and lead him in the procession.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Then Jennie went into the house to bring
out T’férgore. Jennie was not only my
doctor, but she had turned up her sleeves
and showed Lena how to cook the dishes I
could eat. She had discharged two nurses,
one after the other, and relied on herself
and Lena’s help, and Julian’s solicitude.</p>

<p>“You never know what a woman is until
you try her in a family crisis,” said Julian,
sitting down near me. “I wasn’t enamored
of your Dr. Purdy before, but I’ll say this
of her now: she has the coolest head, the
readiest hand, and the largest fund of domestic
skill of any woman I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“I always told you that,” said I in a
superior tone.</p>

<p>“She’s stayed by us to the neglect of her
city practice, I’m afraid,” said Julian.</p>

<p>“She is just getting into practice,” I
assured him, “and before coming out here
announced her intention of leaving town for
a change. It has been a severe change,
though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“But a man has been here importuning
her about something.”</p>

<p>I took hold of the arms of my chair.
“What kind of a man, Julian?”</p>

<p>“Oh, an ordinary person. Nothing striking
about him. I thought he looked very
sulky the last time he went away.”</p>

<p>“Jennie was short with him, was she?”</p>

<p>“She saw him only a few minutes each
time, after the first, and I thought she was
rather peremptory. There’s Doctor Theophilus
again, and he’s footed it from the
Avenue station. The Reverend never was
so devoted to us as he has been since T’férgore’s
arrival,” said Julian, smiling drolly.</p>

<p>I had a nervous dread of Julian’s uncle;
he was the most respectable man who ever
had the right to add Doctor of Divinity to
his name. Large, broad, and ponderous, his
mere presence seemed to reprehend the playful
antics of life. I was afraid of his long
upper lip, which shut as close as a snuff-box
lid. His white neckties awed me, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
solidity of his choice words reproached me.
Behind his back, and in spite of Julian’s
laughing remonstrance, I had rechristened
Uncle Doctor Theophilus, whose surname
was Marvin, The Old Daguerreotype. It is
true he had not his case on, though the snap
with which it formerly shut had probably
passed into his lips. I could even fancy that
when you got a side-light on him he retained
the glare of the old daguerreotype, and effaced
himself in a sheet of glitter. His expression
seemed unalterably made up; and
though he looked more ancient than other
men of his age, I knew he thought himself
well taken, and all his tints neat without
being gaudy. He oppressed me so that I
frequently wanted to rub him out. I always
trod on a stone and turned my foot, or ran
against a chair, when the Old Daguerreotype
was by. Or he threw me into a nervous
trance, and I sat with parted lips, glaring
eyes, and aching neck, fancying that my own
daguerreotype was being taken. Aunt Doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Theophilus used to be a worthy companion
picture to him, but death years ago effaced
her lineaments and snapped her case shut,
to be opened no more.</p>

<p>I felt that I could hardly stand the Old
Daguerreotype just at this time, but said to
Julian it was kind of him, taken in such a
precise attitude as he was, to dust himself
walking out from the Avenue, on our account.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t the first time he has done it,”
said Julian. “Something about our rural
domicile has seized upon Uncle Doctor. He
didn’t go out of town this year, and he’s
taking whiffs of the country between sermons.”</p>

<p>“Between poses,” I suggested softly. “I
hope Jennie isn’t bothered by his coming.
She takes strong antipathies, and he does
make one’s backbone ache.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she stands it,” said Julian laughing,
“affably, as if she were the artist who had
taken him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>I turned around towards Jennie as Julian
went to the gate to meet his uncle. She was
bringing T’férgore across the porch and
smoothing down the angel robes. She herself
looked like a Madonna picture, pale
and somewhat saddened, but most womanly,
most touching.</p>

<p>“Jennie,” I said, as she put T’férgore on
my lap, standing before me to do so, “you
have taken care of me as only a woman can,
and pulled me through to paradise.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she replied quickly, “you took
care of me first. I think I must have been
out of my senses. But having this little
monster to handle made things appear very
different.”</p>

<p>T’férgore blinked lazily, and struck out
with ineffectual fists. The cherub-wings
were perhaps hidden in folds of mull, but
gazing on this wonderful creature’s allurements,
I was seized with a Saturn-like desire
to bite and devour every flower-tinted
atom. I forgot that the Old Daguerreotype<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
was at the gate, and worried my prey, breaking
into a rhapsody of baby Romany.</p>

<p>In the midst of my Bess’ums and S’eetums,
and Old Dol’ums, Uncle Doctor appeared
before me, and bent himself at T’férgore’s
shrine, with an expression nearly as
idiotic as my own. He clucked, whistled,
and snapped his fingers, and for one moment
I thought he was going to dance. But his
legs were taken too stiffly for that, and he
only limbered his entire length and cracked
the glass in a way which damaged him forever
as my Old Daguerreotype.</p>

<p>Then he straightened himself up apologetically
and shook hands with Jennie, saying
in his most ministerial tones, “And how
are you to-day, Dr. Jane?”</p>

<p>I must say that everything Uncle Doctor
did on this occasion astonished me. It was
the first time I had been permitted to see a
visitor, and they should have prepared me
for the unusual side-lights I should now
catch upon the Old Daguerreotype. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
held professional women in disdain, and I
had heard him utter homilies against wives
who tacked all their maiden or acquired
names before their husband’s cognomen.
Yet here he was parading Dr. Jane’s title,
and almost capering before her in his exuberant
desire to win favor.</p>

<p>They sat down around me, and I noticed
how unembarrassed Jennie was by the Daguerreotype’s
white tie and the clip of his
lips and fearful respectability.</p>

<p>“A little daughter in the house,” said
Uncle Doctor Theophilus, indicating with
pomp the human atom in my lap, “is indeed
a well-spring of pleasure.”</p>

<p>“We counted on her brother Trotwood
Copperfield, instead of his sister Betsey Trotwood,”
said Julian.</p>

<p>“It was a mere fancy,” I insisted, “and
girls are just as good as boys any day.”</p>

<p>“Better,” granted Julian.</p>

<p>“I’m quite as glad that T’férgore is a girl.”</p>

<p>“But it disarranges the name,” said Julian.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
“His name was Fergus Dering, but I think
we shall have to call her Ferguson.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I dissented indignantly.</p>

<p>“T’férgore!” mused Uncle Doctor Theophilus.
“What kind of un-Christian appellation
have you stumbled upon there?”</p>

<p>“The name being Fergus,” explained
Julian, “we call her—as Lena would put
it—T’férgore in short.”</p>

<p>We sat in silences of several minutes at a
time, hearing an apple drop in the orchard,
the call of the katydids, or the restless stepping
of Leander in his stable. Already the
smoky light of autumn was mellowing distances.</p>

<p>“How remote this little spot appears to
be from the centres of traffic,” said Uncle
Doctor Theophilus, with a pulpit gesture.</p>

<p>“It’s a good place for fever patients,” said
Dr. Jane in a tone of authority. “There’s
health in the air of the house.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should apprehend as much,” asserted
Uncle Doctor Theophilus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“You mean the intellectual atmosphere,
of course,” said Julian, as a whiff of the sauerkraut
Lena did love came around the house.
“Oh yes, we are remote, but we have had
great company here. Emerson has uttered
wisdom from your chair, Uncle Doctor, and
near him sat Hawthorne, and against that
tree leaned Thoreau. We have even had
what some fantastic literary fellow calls the
tone poets all around us, and no end of
painters and sketchers.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing but a play of ours,” I
explained. “Whenever I wished we had
such people for visitors, Julian piled chairs
full of their books, or their music, or stood
up copies of their pictures. Then we talked
to them, and Julian read from them in reply,
or I ran over the musical score, or he hung
a picture where it could speak for itself.
In that way he thinks we enjoyed just as
close communion with them as their nearest
friends ever had; because their elusive souls
would speak to us more directly and coherently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
than if they were sitting opposite us in
the flesh.”</p>

<p>The Old Daguerreotype shook his head
indulgently over such pastime. On deliberation,
however, he said the next time we had
such a gathering he would like to join it.</p>

<p>After supper, and while Uncle Doctor
Theophilus and Julian were trailing their
feet through the grass, carrying their hands
behind them, and all but chewing the bovine
cud in their ruminative gazing on the bee-hives,
the orchard, the stable, and meadow,
Jennie put on her hat and gloves to drive
our relative back to the Avenue station. I
knew the drive would be good for her.</p>

<p>“You can come home the long way,
through the creek—the water is always low—after
you have left him at his train,” I
hinted.</p>

<p>“I guess I shall go the long way,” said
Jennie. “It will be pleasanter having someone
to talk with.”</p>

<p>T’férgore and I exchanged a long stare;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
that is, I exchanged a long stare with T’férgore
for a series of self-absorbed blinks.</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” I then remarked to Jennie,
“that you aren’t put out by the old
Dag—Doctor; when I say old, I mean, of
course, reverend; for he isn’t really elderly,
you know.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t put me out a bit,” answered
Jennie. “He is very quieting to me. I
believe he is a sound man.”</p>

<p>“There is no man sounder,” I declared.
“And he was just as good as he could be to
his wife. I think she actually died because
there was nothing more she could ask of life.
I never saw such a self-satisfied expression
as she had—outside of a miniature. His
position is excellent and influential, too. A
woman can’t help looking at that sort of
thing when she is once married.”</p>

<p>Jennie turned about to face me, smiling.
“Now, don’t, my dear, don’t,” she objected.
“Let us not give our talk any such bias.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t,” I exclaimed apprehensively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
“I’m not throwing anybody at you at all.
I was just going to say that though he is
such an excellent man, and near to Julian
and all that, he ossifies the working of my
joints: I feel in such awe of him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Jennie.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve noticed that.”</p>

<p>“I think his society is wholesome for
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it seems to be mutual,” I could
not help suggesting. “Either you or T’férgore
is limbering him up until I do believe
in the course of time his presence will become
wholesome for <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Leander, drawing Jennie and the Old
Daguerreotype in our red cart, went briskly
down the road, and Julian and T’férgore and
I sat watching them.</p>

<p>“They will loiter through the woods,”
mused I, “and watch the festoons of grapevine,
and get a sniff of sycamore leaves and
pennyroyal mixed with loam.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Julian. “Next week I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
take you and Ferguson off through the woodsiest
drive of them all.”</p>

<p>“Julian,” I remonstrated, “her name isn’t
and it never will be Ferguson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Julian, “the bill is laid
on the table then. Another motion will be
in order.”</p>

<p>“And they’ll see bunches of goldenrod
in a thicket,” I continued, returning to
Leander’s load, “and the Old Daguerreotype
will jump out to get it for her, footing
it lightsomely among the burrs.”</p>

<p>“You make quite a beau of our uncle,”
said Julian, turning his cigar over.</p>

<p>“Well, I should think anybody could see
that’s what he wants to be considered.”</p>

<p>“He has my consent,” said Julian.</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” said I, taking high grounds;
“but I’m not so sure about Jennie. She’s
a woman who has been hard to suit. Nothing
else stood in the way of her marrying long
ago.”</p>

<p>I looked keenly at Julian, but he evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
knew naught about the one month divorced
man with a wife and five children—the
youngest two years old. It was the only
secret I had ever kept from him, and it
burned guiltily at the roots of my tongue.
But the woman who reveals to her lord and
master some unlovely weakness of her own
sex helps him to a judgment-seat too dangerously
lofty.</p>

<p>“She’s what you may really call superior,”
admitted Julian, “but far enough into
the woods to be afraid of the crooked stick.
And Uncle Theoph. isn’t so bad.”</p>

<p>“No,” I granted generously: “he doesn’t
make me half as miserable as he used to.
And I know he won’t mind getting bugs
down his neck and stumbling over old logs
for yellow and chocolate colored pawpaw
leaves and branches of fire-red maple, if
Jennie wants him to.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” Julian ruminated, “if Aunt
Marvin ever made him dance around when
they were young together and she had a ribbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
headdress on her hair, and he choked
himself with a stock.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “she was his first wife.”</p>

<p>Julian reached over, at the risk of waking
T’férgore, and laid his arm across my
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Besides, she never cried,” I added.
“And a good husband is just like a growing
crop: he needs to be rained on.”</p>

<p>Julian uttered a little grunt of contempt,
but it was the kind of contempt which magnified
the importance of his own sex and
therefore did no real harm to ours.</p>

<p>“Uncle Doctor Theophilus is lonely,” said
Julian, “having once lived the life of a
family man.”</p>

<p>“And Jennie is lonely, too,” I admitted,
“having never lived the life of a family
woman. Think how hard it is to stand outside
of—say the little farm—and see T’férgore
come home, and our comfort and satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Man: his wife: his child:” ruminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Julian. “The family; the little spot of our
own ground. That’s the primitive and true
life.”</p>

<p>We heard the creek frogs lifting up their
voices.</p>

<p>“Next summer when T’férgore is big
enough to be carried across the field,” said
I, “I will make a Kate Greenaway dress
with a yoke, and flare a hat of muslin for
her, or better still, pucker her face into a
frilly cap, and set her down in the midst of
the clover where there aren’t any bees.”</p>

<p>“And put a crook in her hand,” said
Julian. “For now we are her sheep. We
can’t stray across blue water until the shepherdess
permits.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1881</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Beetrus Jenkins</span>!” called the owner
of the name, sending her high clear voice
through the boxed space which served as
post-office window.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’m,” responded the postmaster, with
that joking freedom which adds so much
spice to the life of a general-storekeeper at
a South Illinois railroad station. “Three
letters this time. He’s writing nearly every
day.”</p>

<p>“It wears on you to keep track of my
correspondence, don’t it?” affirmed the girl,
taking her letters and rending them open
with impatient forefinger. They were all
addressed, in the same mercantile hand, to
Miss Beatrice Jenkins, Wabash Station, Illinois.
She compared the dates of the postmarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
and opened the earliest, standing by
the door to read.</p>

<p>The smoke-dimmed interior of the store
was hung with baskets, dry-goods, bacon,
ready-made clothing, and boots and shoes.
A skeleton flight of steps ascended across
a background of wall to the proprietor’s
residence, and up this flight of steps went
a neighbor’s barefooted child with a coffee-pot
to borrow some household necessity,
while Beetrus read her mail.</p>

<p>She was a spot of mellow color betwixt
brilliant autumn tints outside and the dim
inclosure. The slim, long-fingered hands
holding her letters were nicely gloved. Her
white hat was covered with plumes just owning
the salmon-pink tint of her small woolen
shawl. Her dress was neutral and unobtrusive.
Not so, however, were her black
eyes and glowing cheeks, or the dark hair
clustering to her ears. She was a very
pretty girl, and this the station-master always
mentally admitted. He came out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
his post-office cubby with the mail-bag in
his hand.</p>

<p>“So you’re going to clear out to-day,
Bee?”</p>

<p>She glanced up, perceptibly starting and
coloring.</p>

<p>“Goin’ by rail or by river?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Beetrus. “Yes, we’re going
up the river. Our things are packed on
the White Dove. We’d have to go so far
around and pay so much freight the other
way. But I don’t like to go on a freight
boat, and neither does ma, though the men
are just as kind and clever as they can be.
We have to sit upon deck all night, too,
among the machinery and grease.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will. It’s a twelve hours’ run
betwixt this and New Harmony against the
current. The White Dove starts about
three o’clock. Will you be down any during
the winter?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Our man and his wife can
tend to everything on the farm. We never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
do run back and forth any after cold weather
sets in.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you’ll put the time in
dancin’ and takin’ music lessons?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so very lively in Harmony; but
I’m going on with my music—That isn’t
the train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” responded the station-master,
swinging the mail-bag as he walked forth to
keep appointment with the black and hissing
locomotive sliding to its brief pause.</p>

<p>Beetrus flew through the store, ran down
the back steps, and sheltered herself in
woods which stretched away toward the Wabash.
Swift as her exit was, she scarcely
escaped the eye of a young man who swung
himself off the train, sample case in hand.
His face twinkled humorously, which it
could very well do, being a pleasant mustached
face in spite of the marks of dissipation
it bore. His trim dress and brisk air
bespoke the prosperous commercial traveler.</p>

<p>He went indoors and swept a business-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> 
glance around before the train steamed
away; therefore by the time the station-master
had put up the mail and served one
or two customers, he had a satisfactory order
written out, and professed himself ready to
mount the next train, for which he would
have to wait quite two hours.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know how to put the time in,”
said the station-master, “as long as we have
any pretty girls left in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>The drummer smiled out of the back door
at a huddle of two or three cabins and board
huts, as if the capacity of such a place for
producing pretty girls was too contemptible
a joke for him to meddle with. He said he
guessed he would go down to the landing
and see if he couldn’t get a skiff a while.</p>

<p>“Bee Jenkins will be down that way,”
suggested the station-master. “She was in
here a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Ran from me,” noted the drummer.</p>

<p>“I’d kind of advise her to, if she hadn’t,”
said the station-keeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“What’s the objection to me?” laughed
the drummer; “I’m only a good gray sinner.
They’ll have to dip me several times
more before I’m as black as you South Illinois
Egyptians.”</p>

<p>“Old lady Jenkins will have a crow to
pick with you, though, if she happens to
drop onto all these letters and walks.”</p>

<p>“You undertake too much,” said the
drummer, shaking his head with gentle persuasiveness.
“The store and post-office and
station and the neighborhood will accumulate,
and be too many for you.”</p>

<p>Beetrus saw him sauntering on her track.
The blood was buzzing in her head, and she
hid herself upon a pile of steep high rocks,
obeying some wild impulse of which she felt
ashamed. To follow him with her eyes and
be herself invisible was an impersonal rapture
in which she could indulge without giving
it too great advantage. Yet, when he
disappeared near the river, she felt a stinging
check in her heart, and a sense of having
inflicted loss and robbery upon herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>To Beetrus he was the walking essence of
the world, representing not only its mighty
business, but its advantages of culture and
travel. She never had been from home
except to Evansville and New Harmony;
and he never stayed two nights in a place,
and spoke with fatigue of his exciting life.
What operas he had seen!—for in Beetrus’s
chaotic imagination all theatrical performance
was opera, and operas were the
distinct possessions of the worldly.</p>

<p>She resented with a mixture of awe and
daring the greatness of his relatives. He
was a nephew of the head of his commercial
house, and his grandfather had been a congressman;
while her background was the
pioneer’s cabin, the pecan woods, and Wabash
rocks and hills.</p>

<p>Beetrus was the child of a shrewd though
romance-soaked mother, who had dowered
her with something more than a mispronounced
fine name and biased imagination.
It is strange to think how large a human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
mass, moving this instant in grooves of
practical action, is protesting with secret
scorn against all its conditions. Beetrus
was full of a girl’s unrests and eccentric impulses.
She thought she knew exactly what
she wanted for her happiness.</p>

<p>She pressed her cheek against the rock
lichens, taking a half-inverted view of the
autumn tangle, and glad in spite of herself
for the pleasant breath of life. It was
worth while to be a part of such woods and
river vistas, and to smell all the ground’s
odors. Some little living thing ran along a
log not far from her; and she could hear
a squirrel bark, a whish and a whisper of
loosened leaves as they were sent adrift, and
then the dropping of a nut. Strong as the
sunlight was, she shivered upon the rocks,
and then felt all her blood burn, beat, and
tremble.</p>

<p>The commercial traveler was walking
back with a brisk step from the river, and
scanning every opening among the trees, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
if on an eager search. He saw Beetrus rising
and tightening her pink shawl on her
shoulders, and halted with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” was his unceremonious
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Up here, reading my letters and viewing
the country.”</p>

<p>“You saw me go past, then, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Was it you?” said she, fitting her foot
deftly to the steep descent.</p>

<p>“Let me lift you down. How pretty you
look this morning!”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t talk about pretty, Mr.
Poundstone,” said Beetrus, dyed in color,
after he had stood her upon the moss, dazed
as she always was by his prevailing presence.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have hid; I want to
talk up a scheme with you right off. It
popped into my head since I got off the
train.”</p>

<p>“What scheme?” said Beetrus, hugging
her shawl and looking over her shoulder to
simulate complete indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“You know well enough, or can guess.
We mustn’t be parted, my dear girl; I
can’t run up to New Harmony every time
I make a trip down this way. Think of
the long winter. Don’t you want to see me
this winter?”</p>

<p>“Oh—yes,” she admitted, with a gasp.</p>

<p>“I want to see you. I want to have you
entirely to myself, to look forward to every
time I come in off the road. Let’s get
married.”</p>

<p>Beetrus visibly expanded and contracted
with a great breath.</p>

<p>“Get on the train and go over to Evansville
with me, and we’ll have the minister
tie the knot there. Then home. And a
nice little private set of rooms, all quiet and
to ourselves, and no relations to bother us.”</p>

<p>“But ma’s fixed things to go up to New
Harmony for the winter,” whispered Beetrus,
struggling with this vision. “And she
wouldn’t change her mind so suddenly—’specially
as she doesn’t know you real well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“It isn’t ma I want to marry,” argued
Poundstone, using his winning smile. “I’ll
drop my relations, and you can surely do
the same.”</p>

<p>“Drop ma!”</p>

<p>The girl was stung by a covert insult.</p>

<p>“Leave her a little while. Let her go up
to New Harmony, you know.”</p>

<p>“And what do you mean about dropping
your relations?” demanded Beetrus, growing
straighter and more self-assured, and burning
more vividly in the cheeks. “That they
wouldn’t want to be acquainted with ma
and me? No, sir; I ain’t going to let her
go up to New Harmony alone; and I never
would seriously have you unless she knew all
about it and was willing. She might have
read your letters if she wanted to; she knows
about them. I never did anything in my life
that ma told me not to do.”</p>

<p>“I thought five minutes’ talk on this subject
would bring you to reason,” remonstrated
Poundstone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“Then you didn’t calculate right.”</p>

<p>“So it seems.”</p>

<p>“I’m not the girl you took me for.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to break off with me entirely?”
he exclaimed, with heat.</p>

<p>“Yes—come to that—I do!” cried Beetrus,
flinging his letters at him, two fluttering
uncertain, but one moulded by the grip
of her hand and darting like a missile. “I
believed in you, and see how you’ve treated
me!”</p>

<p>“My darling girl!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you come around in my sight any
more. And go marry somebody that won’t
cause any <i>dropping</i>. I can stand it.”</p>

<p>“I believe you can,” he sneered.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; I can stand it. So good-by
to you.”</p>

<p>Saying which, Beetrus turned and scudded
off, through Spanish needles and boggy spots,
until his first half-uttered remonstrance had
been for some time changed into language
of another sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>It seemed long before Beetrus found a log
on which she could draw herself, face downward,
with her arms stretched beyond her
head.</p>

<p>The White Dove moved off from Wabash
Landing two hours behind her appointed
time. She was a dirty little boat, carrying
a miscellaneous freight, but among the barrels
on the after-deck some hard-favored and
much-whittled chairs had been placed for
Beetrus and her mother.</p>

<p>The young girl herself stood by the rope
which served for railing, and saw her own
heartache color all those fair distances.
Downy swells of remote banks and bold juts
of rock were copied in the river, so ruffleless
did it seem to lie even when the strong current
was moving. A blue heron stood at the
water edge meditating, with one foot planted
on sand and the other tucked up. It slightly
spread its mighty wings, shook them, and
folded them again to place, without appearing
to break the trance of its downward stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>While the White Dove churned along,
shadows stretched upon the Wabash. Now
it was very late afternoon, and now it threatened
to be evening, with a hint that by and
by it would be night, when you might expect
the woods to make deep black borders along
the river, and the canopy of stars to look
smeared by the little steamer’s smokestack.</p>

<p>When Beetrus was pale and tired, she
turned and leaned against her mother—an
ample, indulgent woman, who nevertheless
had one bristling mole upon the right side
of her face. She broke the tacit silence in
which they had begun their journey by declaring,
“Ma, I love you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t often put a body out telling
them that,” responded Mrs. Jenkins, uttering
a gratified laugh.</p>

<p>“I keep up a dreadful loving, though,”
said Beetrus, casting sidewise at the river
black eyes which swam in waters of their
own.</p>

<p>“You’re my baby,” cooed her mother, patting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
the slim hand fondling her neck.
“There’s plenty of pretty young men in the
world, but there’s only one old mother.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about the young
men,” said Beetrus, with strong scorn. “I
was thinking a good while in the woods to-day,
coming from the post-office, and I’ve
made up my mind never to get married.”</p>

<p>“You’ll turn around often enough before
the time comes.”</p>

<p>“I never will,” emphasized Beetrus. “We’ll
be two nice old ladies together, ma, and neither
of us will get married.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, for a sure thing,” laughed her
mother. “But you’ll only be middle-aged
when I’m ready to totter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” said Beetrus sadly. “And
then if one would die and leave the other”—</p>

<p>“Now, now, don’t you fret, lovey. I’ve
had consider’ble trouble and experience, and
if I don’t sigh round, you needn’t. Who’s
that nice-looking man that keeps looking
back this way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>Beetrus had been facing down river, with
her mind completely closed to any moving
figures on deck. She glanced back over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s”—she exclaimed, swallowing
her breath with a gasp—“it’s Mr. Poundstone.”</p>

<p>“That correspondent of yours?” said Mrs.
Jenkins, nodding her head, and inspecting
him sincerely with such thoroughness as intervening
barrels permitted.</p>

<p>Beetrus’s ears rang. She had, however,
that instinctive western courage which sometimes
takes the place of disciplined self-control;
so by no other clue than the deepening
fire of her cheeks and eyes did she
give Mr. Poundstone any knowledge of the
disturbance he brought her when he climbed
a passage over impediments and placed himself
in the party.</p>

<p>His manner was subdued, even becomingly
humble and conciliatory.</p>

<p>“Ma, this is Mr. Poundstone,” said Beetrus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
secretly triumphant in being free from
the subservience which yesterday would have
made her say, “Mr. Poundstone, this is my
mother.”</p>

<p>She did not add to her unconsidered formula
now, but allowed him to lift his hat
and bow over her mother’s hand.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to meet you, Mrs. Jenkins,”
said he. “I want to make friends with you,
and get you to convince your daughter I’m
not such a bad fellow as I look.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look like a bad fellow,” she
responded heartily.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were going up on
the boat,” said Beetrus, regarding with gentle
indifference the brim of his hat, after he
replaced it.</p>

<p>“You know I couldn’t go off on the train
and leave matters in the shape they are. I
never sold a bill of goods in New Harmony
in my life, but I’m going to try to make
a satisfactory trade for myself now, if the
house turns me off for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Beetrus parted her lips smiling, and this
time met him in the eyes. Without formulating
the fact, she knew there was sterling
man under the crust of acquired coarseness.
The brutal plan he had formed concerning
her, and which he was now scarcely willing
to acknowledge to himself, began to withdraw
from betwixt them like the mist which already
wavered on the hills.</p>

<p>“I believe it will be a clear day to-morrow,”
the girl said, falling back upon good
commonplace.</p>

<p>“Do you believe it will be a clear day to-morrow,
Mrs. Jenkins?” inquired Poundstone.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems like it might be pretty,”
responded the widow, turning up her face to
see the pinkness reflected from the west.</p>

<p>“Then I believe it will too,” said the commercial
traveler, with a devout air, which was
unmoved by Beetrus’s laughing out,—</p>

<p>“A great deal prettier and clearer than
to-day has been.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE BRIDE OF ARNE SANDSTROM</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1885</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Big</span> Swede wedding over there this
evening,” said one passer to another by his
side. “Peter Lund’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“Is she marrying a Swede?” inquired
the second.</p>

<p>“Yes; fellow by the name of Arne Sandstrom.”</p>

<p>“I should think old Peter, well off as he
is, would have looked higher for a son-in-law—you
or me, for instance,” observed the
second youth, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“The girl’s pretty as a pink, and has had
every advantage. It is a pity to see her
thrown away; but old Peter has a lot of
younger ones coming on.”</p>

<p>“That makes it less an object. I thought
she was his only. The Swedes are clannish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Peter Lund’s is headquarters for them,
too. Here’s one now, hunting up the wedding.
I’ll bet she’s just arrived from the
old country.”</p>

<p>So near the truth was this surmise that
Elsa had been off the train only twenty
minutes, and in that time had repeated the
name of Arne Sandstrom interrogatively to
every person she met. She was dazed by
long riding and partial fasting, and the
dumb terror of finding no one to receive her
at the end of her great journey. The letter
created with much brain-work to announce
her coming ought to have been in his hands
weeks ago. The innocent and friendless
soul did not know she had omitted all dates
and exactness in her general care for spelling
and inky loops. So stepping off the
train into the American town at dusk, she
saw stretches of summer prairie to the westward,
perky architecture, crossing railroad
tracks, hurrying citizens, and lazy loungers—even
the new electric light on its spider-work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> 
iron tower beginning to make a ghastly
powerful star far above her head. She saw
baggage and piles of express matter, hotel
runners, and other women, starting toward
their assured homes, tucked laughing and
chatting under their husbands’ arms; but she
saw not one face or one kind hand ready to
bid her welcome, who had ventured thousands
of miles alone—across ocean, across
continent—to marry her betrothed lover,
Arne Sandstrom.</p>

<p>Hearing his name spoken, she stood still
upon the sidewalk, shrinking and timid, but
directly in front of the young men, and inquired,
using hands and eyes as well as
anxious inflection of voice, “Arne Sandstrom?”</p>

<p>“She wants to know where Arne Sandstrom
is. Right over there—that big
house, which you see lighted up. She
doesn’t understand. Arne Sandstrom over
there. Getting married! Yes, yes. Arne
Sandstrom. Here, Jack, you trot out a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Swedish, can’t you? You’ve been
among them more than I have.”</p>

<p>“Arne Sandstrom <i>derover</i>,” exclaimed the
other, pointing to Peter Lund’s house, with
a fine assumption of handling the language
well. “Arne Sandstrom <i>jifta</i> to-night, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yifta!” said Elsa, shrinking down in
stature.</p>

<p>“She’s got hold of it. That’s all right.
You’ll be in time for the wedding.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t understand; she thought we
were making fun of her,” said one of the
lads as they sauntered on.</p>

<p>“She did understand, and there she goes
straight across the street. Brush up in the
languages, young man, and make yourself
as useful to the public as I am.”</p>

<p>When Elsa had entered the Lund premises,
however, she did not ring the bell,
but wavered around the house, looking up at
lighted windows, and shifting her little bundle
from one arm to the other. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
other baggage at the station, but it seemed
no longer worth while. There was a western
veranda, on the lowest step of which she sat
down in quiet stupor to collect herself for
some determined movement.</p>

<p>Anguish and disappointment must be the
natural lot in this world, only she had not
lived enough years to find it out before.
Though summer darkness had come, the
after-glow was still so bright in the west that
it half quarreled with abundant lamplight.
Elsa could hear the front gate, the crunch of
coming footsteps, and frequent peals of the
door-bell, as she sat drawn together, and the
eternal minutes traveled on.</p>

<p>Peter Lund’s house was full of joyful stir.
China and silver tinkled in the open dining-room,
where several women were putting last
touches to the tables. Girls flew up and
down the back stairway, calling to one another
in Swedish.</p>

<p>“One thing is sure, Yennie Yonsen,”
called a voice in the home tongue, “there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
will not be enough married women to take
the bride from us girls in the wedding dance;
so now what will Arne Sandstrom do?”</p>

<p>Three of them conspired together by the
western dining-room door, bobbing their
flaxen heads, all laughing and talking at
once in their light happiness, far above the
unseen stranger on the step.</p>

<p>“Who told me Arne Sandstrom left a betrothed
girl in Svadia?” said one, lowering
her voice to graver colloquy.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, she married, herself, of course,”
replied another; “and any man who could
get Lena Lund would take her.”</p>

<p>“Lena’s so pretty.”</p>

<p>“Lena’s rich.”</p>

<p>“Lena can sing and play better than
some Amerikanskä.”</p>

<p>“Lena has ten new dresses. Arne will
not have to put his hand in his pocket for
many a day.”</p>

<p>“She is not spoiled therewith. I always
liked her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“Ah, my mother said if this wedding was
going to be in Svadia this St. John’s Eve,
what a night we would make of it!”</p>

<p>They ran away, while Elsa repeated to
herself that this was the Eve of St. John—night
of arbors and rejoicing at home, night
when the sun scarcely went down, and everybody
feasted and visited under green-leaf
tents. Of what use was St. John’s Eve, or
any other portion of time, to a girl put to
shame and despair as she was? Why had
Arne Sandstrom sent her money to come
over with if he meant to jilt her on her arrival?
Or had he picked another betrothed
for her as well as himself? She would not
believe her Arne could be so evil; she would
knock and ask for him. He was so kind!
he loved her. Yet not only the Amerikanns,
but those laughing girls, had said plainly
this was Arne Sandstrom’s wedding; any
man would take Lena Lund who could get
her; Lena was so pretty; Lena was rich;
Lena could sing and play better than some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Amerikanskä; Lena had ten new dresses,
and she was not spoiled.</p>

<p>Elsa bruised her cheek against the edge
of the second step above her. She did not
know where to go, and her money was all
spent except the little she had saved by going
without food during part of her railway
journey, and she had saved that to buy some
little ornament for her new home with Arne.
She might try to hire herself out, but how
could she ever write back home where such
happy news was expected from her, or how
could she put unendurable anxiety upon those
best friends by not writing at all? Svadia
was so pleasant, especially in the long nightless
summers. Good and kind they were to
strangers there: her mother always baked
waffles and carried them with coffee to the
morning bedside of a guest. She could see
her native meadows stretching away in the
blue northern air, and the iron whip, as her
mother called the scythe, beating up an appetite
in those who wielded it, while she herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
a careless little maid, came bearing the
second breakfast to the mowers.</p>

<p>A quavering but hearty voice, which
might have come from the mouth of her own
grandmother if it had not belonged to Peter
Lund’s mother, sung out a Lapp-Finn nurse
song by an upper window, and Elsa knew
just what syllables the dancing baby was
made to emphasize.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Perhaps this very instant—for Elsa made
no calculations in longitude and time—vader’s
mütter danced the baby under her home
roof; and none of her people knew how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
faint, how outcast, how bewildered the eldest
child felt sitting on steps in a strange
Amerikanski town.</p>

<p>In Elsa’s box of clothing was the finest
sheepskin blanket her mother ever made, so
white in fleece, and cured by buttering and
scraping until the skin yielded soft like
chamois leather. It was lined with scarlet
flannel. She could see the storeroom of her
father’s farmhouse hung thickly with such
fleeces, and hear her mother say she wished
Elsa could take more, since they had so little
money to send with her. But Arne Sandstrom
had sent the money to pay her way,
because he loved her so. They were children
together, and he was held as dear as a
son in her own family. Elsa’s mother never
distrusted him. How could it therefore be
possible that Arne Sandstrom, after sending
for his betrothed, could be marrying a Swede
Amerikanskä fleka the very evening of her
arrival?</p>

<p>In her intensely quiet fashion the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
girl was wiping away tears as fast as they
dripped down her cheeks, and now she lifted
her head from the step, coming to a decision.</p>

<p>She walked up on the veranda, her feet
sounding heavy and uncertain, and stood at
the door ready to knock. Her piteous great
eyes moved from wall to wall of the ample
dining-room, recognizing Svensk wooden
spoons and beautifully painted and polished
Russian bowls in various sizes on the side-board.
Hard-baked Svensk bread, so loved
by the white and firm Scandinavian teeth,
and all known home luxuries, with unheard-of
Amerikanski things, smiled at her
from the glittering tables. This Lena Lund
would be called a mamzelle in Svadia; she
was very much above a poor yungfrau like
Elsa. Any man might be glad to marry
her. Still Elsa would not believe Arne
Sandstrom had forgotten his betrothed.</p>

<p>She could see him from where she stood,
in an inner room with a background of fine
furniture. How beautiful he looked, all in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Amerikann clothes, and with soft dark gloves
on his hands, like a very rich man! His
cheek was ruddy, his forehead white, and the
very round of his ear—how well Elsa remembered
it! Arne Sandstrom was happy,
and laughing aloud with other people. She
heard his voice while she stood just without,
so wretched her whole soul seemed numb.</p>

<p>In perfect silence she waited, and still
saw him laugh and extend his hand to have
it shaken by one and another, until a figure
came out of the room where he was, to
pass through the dining-room, and she knew
in an instant Otto Jutberg, who came to
America with Arne. Elsa put her foot
across the threshold and said, to call his attention,
“Otto.”</p>

<p>Otto approached the door and looked curiously
at her. One rope of her flaxen hair
hung down on her breast, and she looked
travel-worn.</p>

<p>“Otto Jutberg, I want to see Arne Sandstrom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Arne is going to be married in a few
minutes,” said Otto.</p>

<p>“I know he is. But I want to see Arne
Sandstrom. Tell him to come here.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” pressed Otto, coming
nearer to her, and knitting his brows inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Otto, when you
have been to my father’s nearly every St.
John’s Eve of our lives?”</p>

<p>Elsa felt that she needed only one more
drop to her cup, and that for some voice
to raise the derisive song with which her
countrymen mocked Scowneys, or inhabitants
of a region the butt of all Svadia.</p>

<p class="center">“A Scowen, a Scowen”—</p>

<p>one bar was enough to rouse sudden rage in
any Svensk.</p>

<p>But instead of “A Scowen, a Scowen,”
rising around Elsa’s ears this enchanted
night, such a din of outcries was made by
Otto Jutberg that people ran to look into the
dining-room, and then to swarm around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Arne Sandstrom leaped two chairs and
seriously jarred one table, to receive Elsa
in his arms, when he kissed her openly.</p>

<p>“Bring me one of the chairs I kicked
over,” he exclaimed, “and let me set the
tired darling in it. I have been looking for
the letter which would tell me when you intended
to start. Yes, this is my Elsa,” he
announced, displaying her; “and how did
she find her way in here alone? Mrs. Lund,
Elsa has come!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she has been crying,” said the
plump wife of Peter Lund, pressing her
hand. “It was enough to break any child’s
heart to reach such a journey’s end homesick
and unwelcomed.”</p>

<p>At this Elsa leaned against the matron’s
side, and shook with sudden sobs, feeling her
forehead and hair petted by a good mother’s
palms.</p>

<p>Elsa was taken upstairs by both Mrs.
Lund and Arne, who talked rapidly across
her. She was put into a beautiful room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
and young girls came to get acquainted with
her. Arne asked her for that piece of metal
which would redeem her baggage, and he
handed it over to Otto at the door. Before
she understood her position, or was quite
able to lift her eyes and look at all who
wanted to talk to her, the box which had
borne her company from Svadia was brought
in, and Arne told her the other wedding
would be put off half an hour while she got
ready. Then he drove the merry company
out of the room, and stood with his back
to the door to keep at bay that moment all
volunteering bride attendants.</p>

<p>“Can you be ready in half an hour, after
your long journey, my darling?” said he.</p>

<p>“I can soon wash off the dust and change
my dress,” said Elsa. “But, Arne, I do not
know anything. Who is going to marry Lena
Lund?”</p>

<p>“Arne Sandstrom. And you will be married
at the same time.”</p>

<p>“I thought that was what you and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Lund said. But who is going to marry
me?”</p>

<p>“<i>Who!</i> I am—Arne Sandstrom.”</p>

<p>“I will not do it,” said Elsa. “They
never have two wives in Svadia.”</p>

<p>Arne Sandstrom gazed silently at her,
puffed and exploded his cheeks, and bent
over, striking his knees with those delicately
gloved hands Elsa had first noted with such
awe. He roared in the fervor of his laughter.
This American country had in no way abated
Arne Sandstrom as a Norseman.</p>

<p>“Oh, Elsa, my snowbird, if I should tell
this on thee they would laugh at thee from
one end of town to the other. Lena Lund’s
bridegroom is my cousin Arne, that came
over with Otto Jutberg and me.”</p>

<p>“That was Arne Peterssen,” affirmed Elsa.</p>

<p>“But there are so many Peterssens and
Yonsens who take their names from their
fathers’ Christian names that Arne changed
his to Sandstrom. It is a very common thing
to do here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Elsa laughed also. It was so simple and
clear and Swedish she wondered that news
of Arne Sandstrom’s wedding had caused
her even a misgiving. She left her chair to
swing Arne’s hands while they both finished
laughing.</p>

<p>“But you ought to be ready,” he cried,
“and not keep the others waiting. I got the
papers for the wedding when Arne got his
papers, so there would be no mistake of
names on the record, and so I could marry
you as soon as you came.”</p>

<p>Within the hour, therefore, Elsa was the
bride of Arne Sandstrom, arrayed in her
dark blue wedding dress of wool, and not
shaming by her statue-like proportions and
fairness the lighter prettiness and silken raiment
of Arne Sandstrom’s American Swedish
bride. Happiness and love were, after all,
the natural lot in this world, thought Elsa,
sitting by her husband in her place of honor
at the wedding supper, and tasting the first
course of such a feast—the Swedish soup
of rice, prunes, raisins, and molasses.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE BABE JEROME</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time, 1892</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> civil engineer sat at breakfast with
his sister. Their table was a stationary one,
on stakes driven into the ground, and they
drank their coffee from tin camp cups with
hooked handles. But the cook served them
with broiled fish and game stew, brown pancakes
and honey.</p>

<p>The tree overhead was still wet with dew.
Lilian had a scarlet shawl around her. She
was a girl whose dark eyes and distinct eyebrows
you noticed at once, adding afterwards
to her personality hair inclined to
cluster about the face, and a general elegance
of figure which her camp dress suggested
instead of outlined.</p>

<p>“As I was bringing my birds in,” said
the civil engineer, “I saw Jerome and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
gander sitting on the top rail of a fence, side
by side. Jerome had his neck stretched up,
whispering to the sky, and the gander had
its neck stretched up, hissing its meditations.
They were a divine pair!”</p>

<p>“As divine as Minerva and her owl, I
should think,” said Miss Brooks. “He
seems to me a tragic figure. How can you
laugh at him?”</p>

<p>“How can you help laughing at him?
But I do pity the old father.”</p>

<p>“And the blind aunt. Eric, I’m going
across the river to see her. I told Mr.
Marsh I would, the next time he came to
camp.”</p>

<p>“He’s coming now. There’s his boat on
the river.”</p>

<p>Lilian watched the boat and the Wabash.
The expanse of limpid water was so shallow
in places that its pebbles glittered in the
sun, or a sand-bar showed under the surface,
while the current in its channel ran
deep and strong. Woods clothed its banks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
and a gauze of blue hung over its southern
bend. Northward a bridge stood on mighty
legs of masonry, screening the work of the
engineer among rapids beyond. A flat-boat
ferry was being poled diagonally across from
the east shore to the west, having for passengers
a farmer and his horse.</p>

<p>The approaching skiff grounded also, and
Jerome’s father stepped slowly out and came
across a stretch of gravel and sward to the
camp. Quantities of gray hair and beard, a
stoop in his shoulders, and a staff in his hand
made him venerable, yet his arms were
strong and his eyes black and piercing. He
was the richest man in his county, and the
man most indifferent to externals. Over
his jeans garments he wore a blue woolen
cape edged with ancient gimp, evidently
taken at random from women’s clothing.</p>

<p>He saw with approval the camp appointments:
the civil engineer’s men breakfasting
at their long table; the cook moving in
and out of a canvas kitchen; and the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
lady’s tent, revealing a pink net-screened
bed, rugs, and stout book-shelves.</p>

<p>“You’re right well fixed over here,” he
called out before the campers could wish
him good-morning.</p>

<p>The engineer said he always tried to
make his camp comfortable.</p>

<p>“And this is as pretty a stretch,” continued
the visitor, drawing nearer, “as you’ll
find between New Harmony and the Ohio.
But ain’t it lonesome for sis here by herself
all day when you and the men’s out?”</p>

<p>“Our cook stays in camp,” said Lilian.
“He has lived in our family since I was a
child. So I feel secure. The friend who
was to have been my companion here was
detained at the last minute. But I made my
brother bring me, anyhow. Will you have
some breakfast, Mr. Marsh?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m obliged: I’ve e’t. I come
across to look after the Babe. He forgits to
have his breakfast sometimes. Seen him on
this side—the Babe Jerome?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“He’s in the woods with his white gander,”
said the engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. Marsh rested against the tree and
braced himself with his staff.</p>

<p>“Billy’s never far off from Jerome.
The Babe gets lonesome on the river, like
sis here, and that gander’s great company
for him. But the Babe likes to be lonesome.
We still call him the Babe,” apologized
the old man, “though he’s twenty-five
year old; scarlet fever done it. He was the
smartest boy on the river. I ’lowed to settle
in Shawnytown, and send him to college.
His mother was a scholar. Now there’s
nothing to do but let him play his music.
He’s a good babe. He never gives me no
uneasiness except forgittin’ his breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he would breakfast with
us?” inquired Lilian.</p>

<p>“Call him,” suggested her brother. “As
for me, I must be excused. There’s a big
day’s work to be done on that bar—time
the men were in the boats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Captain Eric caught up his broad hat,
and flourished it in adieu. The cook ran
after him with a list of needed supplies.
Lilian watched him sitting with folded arms
on his camp-chair in the stern of his boat,
until the rise and fall of oars and the song
of the men drew off to remoteness. She
turned to speak to her visitor, and found
Jerome standing with him.</p>

<p>“Want to go back over?” his father inquired
tenderly.</p>

<p>Jerome shook his head. His visible flesh
had a porcelain quality, like the unstained
clearness of infancy. His hair glittered in
the sun, and he had a long golden mustache,
parting in the centre and trailing down his
mouth corners below his chin. So strong
and manly an ornament sorted strangely
with perplexed blue eyes, that, in spite of a
puzzling world, laughed with the delicious
joy of life. Jerome’s head stood upon a column
of slender body. His clothes, to which
a few burrs were sticking, would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
seemed too fine for his environment if they
had not so exactly suited him.</p>

<p>“Lost his hat again!” bantered the father.
“That’s the fifth straw hat I’ve
bought him this summer.”</p>

<p>“If you will have some breakfast with
me, Jerome,” said Lilian, “I will go to
your house and eat dinner with you.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bargain, ain’t it, Babe?”</p>

<p>The Babe Jerome looked from one to the
other, and smiled, and sat down. His gander,
lifting and shaking both wings, quavered
a remark and waddled to his feet.</p>

<p>“How white Billy is!” said the young
lady, after the cook had brought fresh food
and she had helped her guest.</p>

<p>“The’ ain’t a gray quill on Billy,” observed
Mr. Marsh, his bearded lips relaxing
with contentment.</p>

<p>“And his eyes are blue—blue as the
sky! His bill, with such funny nostrils in
it, is the purest coral. I didn’t know geese
could be so beautiful. You pretty fellow!
Will he hiss me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“No!” spoke Jerome forcibly, startling
her as she stretched a timorous hand to
brush Billy’s plumage. It had satin firmness.
The gander squatted on his webs and
observed in his own language that the caress
was agreeable.</p>

<p>Jerome left off eating and leaned on his
folded arms to smile. He was a sylvan
creature, strayed out of pastoral days into
the hazy regions of the Wabash.</p>

<p>He rowed the boat back, his father sitting
in idle comfort on the other bench, and
Lilian facing the oarsman. She enjoyed
the grace of his torso, the veins swelling on
his hands, the steady innocence of his gaze,
with the same kind of satisfaction given by
a scent of sycamore leaves, or the exquisite
outline of an island. Billy swam after the
boat, the water curling away from his breast;
and before it could be beached he had left his
web marks on the home sands.</p>

<p>The Marsh double cabin, with central
chimney hospitable enough to engulf thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
of swallows, stood on a low bluff.
Another and more imposing house was rising
near it. The workmen’s noise mingled
with stable-yard cackle.</p>

<p>“How I love to hear chickens!” exclaimed
Lilian. “They remind me of some
wonderfully good time I had when I was a
child, though I can’t recall it. You have all
the cheerful racket on your side of the river.
And how sweet the building wood smells!”</p>

<p>“Some of that’s sweet pine,” explained
Mr. Marsh. “The Babe, he carries them
chips, and sassafras bark, and spice-wood, and
all kinds of woods things, in his pockets.”</p>

<p>The Babe looked at Lilian, repeating
slowly what he had told himself many a
lonely day, in forest or on river,—</p>

<p>“I—haven’t got—right sense.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that!” she begged.</p>

<p>The father’s mouth corners fell into leather
grooves.</p>

<p>“But Babe’s got idees,” he maintained.
“He takes to nice things. So did his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
mother. I’d have built the new house long
ago if she’d lived. And I wouldn’t build
it now if it wasn’t for the Babe. Betsey
and me like the cabin. We’ll miss the big
fireplace, and them hooks in the jice beams.
I took Jerome and Betsey down to Shawnytown
to stay one winter, and I’d ’a’ died if
I hadn’t come back here every two weeks.”</p>

<p>“This is a lovely spot,” said Lilian.
“When you are really settled in your new
house, you will enjoy it more than ever.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’s just as the Babe
turns out to like it. The cabin’s been his
cradle. If the new one goes against him
I’ll lock it up and bring him back home.
Come in,” invited the old man, climbing
his doorstep. “Here’s Betsey will be glad
to see you.”</p>

<p>From the smoked and chinked interior
groped a large woman so delicately and completely
white that the blanching appeared to
extend through her eyes, for the lids revealed
them colorless. She wore a black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
net cap and a dress and a cape of faded
lawn. Her heelless soles made no sound
on the bare boards. The palms which she
spread before her had the texture of shriveled
dogwood petals. The stirring of the
lawn clothes set free scarcely detected perfumes,—of
apples, and mint, and the old-fashioned
roses which grow nowhere now
except in remote and dewy country gardens.</p>

<p>“It’s the young lady from the camp,
Betsey, come to visit us to-day.”</p>

<p>“That sounds heartsome,” the blind sister
responded. Lilian took one of her fluttering
hands; the other half unconsciously,
with the swiftness of custom, moved up the
girl’s shoulder and passed over cheek and
head. Lilian noticed in what masses of
wrinkles this handsome old face hung, and
wondered at the miracle of age; at the childish
sweetness that comes back to toothless
talk. “I love to have the young around.
It’s been missly in the house since Babe’s
mother died.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Well, take a cheer,” said Mr. Marsh,
“and I’ll look into the kitchen and tell
Marthy Dempsey who’s for dinner. Marthy
she keeps house for us, and she’s a good
cook; she used to work in a tavern down at
Shawnytown.”</p>

<p>Jerome lingered on the log step while his
father performed the sacred rite of seating a
guest. Aunt Betsey groped toward him.</p>

<p>“But where’s the Babe?”</p>

<p>“The Babe’s as far in as he likes to
come,” said his father. “The Babe’s great
for outdoors in summer time.”</p>

<p>“The dew’s off the garden,” spoke Jerome.</p>

<p>“He never disremembers my walk,”
chuckled the blind woman. “As soon as
the jew is dry he fetches my bonnet.”</p>

<p>Miss Brooks herself tipped the sunbonnet
at a satisfactory angle over the black net
cap, so that its crown sighted the heavens.
Jerome helped his aunt to the ground, and
guided her around the house, his arm on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
her waist. He glanced backward often, to
draw Lilian along, and she sauntered close,
glad to be a part of all this innocent life.</p>

<p>Woods stood at the rear of the garden,
and abrupt Indian mounds ruffled their tufts
of fern almost overhead. It was growing
warm; scarcely a trace of the humid morning
remained, even under burdock leaves,
which Martha Dempsey prized for her butter.
There was a rank hot smell of marigolds
in the sun, with a peppery addition of
bouncing betties. The sweet-williams were
fragrant as honey and long spikes of red or
white hollyhocks swayed in the faintest of
breezes. Aunt Betsey scented the camomile
bed and picked bits of sweet-mary and basil
for Miss Brooks. The sound of the workmen’s
hammers on the house, the rippling of
the river, and the summer call of insects
and birds filled the air, until it seemed to
tremble over green distances with this
weight of pleasant life.</p>

<p>There was a cherry-tree full of ripe black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
fruit. Martha Dempsey came out bare-armed,
but with a sunbonnet pinned shut below
her nose, and, with the unconscious arrogance
of the country maid, ordered Jerome
to pick her some fruit for pies. He pulled
down the lowest branches and filled her tin
pail. Then his aunt and Miss Brooks sat
under the tree and had their laps weighted
with ruby globes on platters of burdock
leaves.</p>

<p>“I like cherries best of any fruit,” said
Lilian, “and these rich red ones most of all.
They get a wicked clip on your tongue that
is delightful.”</p>

<p>Jerome considered her, and said with conviction,
“You look like a cherry.”</p>

<p>“Then these tart fire-drops ought to be
my natural food.”</p>

<p>“This is Babe’s tree,” said Aunt Betsey.
“He planted it, and it has growed with his
growth.”</p>

<p>It was quite dusk when Jerome landed
Miss Brooks at the camp. Her brother
met her, and she exclaimed to him:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“I have had a lovely day! And I persuaded
Jerome to bring his violin and play
for us a while. His playing is wonderful,
Eric.”</p>

<p>“So is Long John’s singing,” observed
the captain with contempt.</p>

<p>From the men’s quarters came an unmelodious
shout of—“Injun puddin’ and a
punkin pie! O, Je-ru-sa-lam!” But this
wavered and ceased when Jerome took up
his violin. His fingers floated along the
strings, and the score he played was never
set down in any brain but his own.</p>

<p>The moon came up, and he played straight
on, tilting his head back and smiling at floating
films in the sky. The cook drew near
from his tent, and the men, smoking, crept as
near as they felt discipline would allow to
the captain’s quarters. Jerome, in the full
beatitude of his one unspoiled talent, knew
no audience. With a final triumphant cry
of the strings, he got up and walked off
without saying good-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“He can sling a bow!” commented one
of the listeners. “They say around here he
plays the birds off the bushes.”</p>

<p>“He is like a girl,” said Miss Brooks to
her brother. “I enjoy having him about
almost as unreservedly as if he were a girl.”</p>

<p>“Glad of it,” replied the captain. “He
can pilot you through the woods. It’s a pity
the poor harmless fellow is daft. He might
have been something.”</p>

<p>Jerome came to camp every day, Billy attending
him. Miss Brooks in her bathing
dress floated on the river, holding to his
boat; and he kept a maternal eye on her
while she disported herself. He brought
her Indian hatchets, and arrow-heads, and a
piece or two of pottery left by the Shawnee
tribe. The two explored creeks and islands
to such extent that Billy frequently left them
in disgust. He snipped grass, and quavered
to himself, while Miss Brooks read or talked
to Jerome.</p>

<p>She talked to Jerome as if he were a rational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
being. His delight in the woods was
even keener than hers, and his knowledge
of wild creatures much greater. He taught
her skill in fishing. His joyful father
brought offerings of eggs and cream and
Martha Dempsey’s peach preserves.</p>

<p>“The Babe pretty nigh lives on this side
of the river now. I ’low I ought to help
victual the camp.”</p>

<p>“We can’t do without him,” said the
girl. “He makes all our good times.”</p>

<p>“The Babe seems to be growin’ older-like
this summer,” mused his father. “He ain’t
to say manlier, but he’s different.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” said Miss Brooks,
startled. Her color faded to ivory. She
was sitting in a hammock, and occasionally
stretched out a sandaled foot to propel it.
The old man felt her beauty with a dumb
jealousy of all bright young creatures who
had not been robbed, like his boy, of their
birthright.</p>

<p>Jerome came later in the afternoon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
found his daily companion still in her hammock,
but changed toward him.</p>

<p>He had just finished an æolian harp for
her. It had required days to properly season
the wood, and other days to assort the
colors and dry the glue which held different
layers together. The instrument was a
thing of beauty, with even little keys to wind
the strings. He had worked over it with
all his faculties excited; and now when he
stood before her, holding it very tenderly on
his arm, she scarcely looked at it.</p>

<p>But Jerome knew what to do. He moved
off with his harp and fixed it in the low fork
of a tree. Then he raised its bridges, and
turned to watch her face. The harp sighed,
and began on a high key “The Last Rose
of Summer,” but after two or three bars,
lost its score in a flood of delicious organ
harmonies. Now it rose to a cry in the
zenith, and now it returned to the “Last
Rose,” and died to a whisper of melody.
It was the passionate revelation of a human
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Jerome smiled and nodded his head; for
the girl’s chin and lips trembled. She let
her book slip down the hammock.</p>

<p>“Talks,” insisted Jerome, claiming her
attention for the harp. “I made it to talk
to you.”</p>

<p>“But it’s so sorrowful,” said Lilian.</p>

<p>“It—isn’t—quite right,” explained Jerome.
“Can’t carry its tune.”</p>

<p>“And you made it for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I been a month.”</p>

<p>“You do too much for me. I have been
very selfish to take so much of your time.”</p>

<p>Jerome put up his lip like a grieved child.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” said Miss Brooks
sharply, blanching white.</p>

<p>“What must I do?”</p>

<p>“Sit down here, and let me read to you.”</p>

<p>He sat on the grass and she read austerely,
the weird heart-cry of the wind harp curving
around her voice or whipping it with ravelings
of sweetness. She read while the sun
slipped lower and lower, and dared not look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
at the rapt face watching her. Then she
shut the book and said with careful modulation:—</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for the wind
harp. I shall take it home with me, and
whenever it plays I shall think of you.”</p>

<p>His grieved lip instantly smiled. “If
you fasten it in your window it will play all
the time!”</p>

<p>“There is one other thing I would love to
have, and that is a feather from Billy.”</p>

<p>Jerome stretched out an arm and drew
his familiar toward him. Billy twitched his
short tail and curved a suspicious neck
while his master stretched one glistening
pinion.</p>

<p>“Do you want his whole wing?” inquired
Jerome, groping for a knife.</p>

<p>“Not for the world!” exclaimed Miss
Brooks. “Only one of dear Billy’s tiniest
feathers, to put away and look at.”</p>

<p>Jerome plucked a quill and handed it to
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“You may have him all, if you want
him.”</p>

<p>“But what would you do without Billy?”</p>

<p>He repeated, “Do without?” several
times, turning the suggestion in his mind,
and gazing at her.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later Miss Brooks said
to her brother:—</p>

<p>“Eric, I believe I will go home at once.”</p>

<p>“Guess not,” responded the captain.
“We shift camp next week. I want you to
stay until then. Aren’t you having a good
time?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been bathing too much in the
river, perhaps. Mr. Marsh says it’s aguish.
I shall have ague if I stay.”</p>

<p>“The doctor is coming,” said her brother.</p>

<p>“I must go home, Eric; indeed, I must!”</p>

<p>“You can’t wait until Jack arrives, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Jack! Is Jack coming?”</p>

<p>“We were going to surprise you; one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
the men rowed to the station for him this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>Miss Brooks’s face expressed lively anticipation.</p>

<p>“Jack is coming! Then I may run back
with him to-morrow, without waiting longer
for Marie.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to give the poor fellow
any taste of the camp?” demanded her indignant
brother.</p>

<p>The wind harp, rousing from silence,
burst out again with the bars it would never
finish, and meandered into saddening minors.</p>

<p>“What machine is making that doleful
sound?”</p>

<p>Lilian turned her tragic face away. Before
Jack arrived she had taken down Jerome’s
offering, wrapped it carefully, and
hid it in the heart of her luggage. The
spirit of the Wabash gave this large and
engaging young arrival its cold shoulder.
Not a drop of rain had tarnished the sunshine
in a month; but he reached camp in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
a chill drizzle. The wind became so sharp
that evening fires were built. The river
hissed against its banks; and the cook reported
a broken trot-line, and consequent
failure in the catch of fish.</p>

<p>“This is fine!” commented Jack, turning
up his collar as he smoked with the captain,
and Lilian huddled to the fire. “Every letter
has been full of the pleasures of camp
life; and now I experience them myself!”</p>

<p>“Give the camp a chance,” remonstrated
Eric. “You couldn’t drag me back to
town! Six months in a year, thank heaven!
I am a man! I live outdoors, free from the
trammels of a soft civilization!”</p>

<p>“We don’t mind the trammels of a soft
civilization, do we, Jack?” said the girl,
snugly slipping her hand into her lover’s.</p>

<p>Jerome appeared at the other side of the
campfire, looking through thin smoke at
her. He had his violin bag on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hello!” the civil engineer hailed him.
“Pull up a chunk, and sit down, Jerome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>Lilian ran to her own tent for another
camp-chair. But Jerome stood still, outside
the wilderness hearth, and looked at the
stranger whose every imposing line was illuminated
by the fire, and who acknowledged
his presence with a nod.</p>

<p>“One of our neighbors from the Illinois
side,” explained the captain.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the river rough to-night?” inquired
Miss Brooks.</p>

<p>Jerome heard the tremor in her voice.
He answered “Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was so good of you to come. I
wanted to hear you play once more. We
may go home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, boy,” urged the captain;
while Jack smoked peacefully.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jerome. “I’ll play out there.”</p>

<p>“Out where?”</p>

<p>“Out there; on the moving water.”</p>

<p>“But I want to talk to you!” exclaimed
Lilian, following him a step, relaxing under
the eye of the man she was to marry. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
want to send messages to your father and
aunt—I may not see them again.”</p>

<p>“Singular chap,” observed Jack as Jerome
walked on into darkness.</p>

<p>“Half witted,” explained Eric.</p>

<p>“He’s not half witted!” vehemently denied
Lilian.</p>

<p>“Quarter witted, then,” amended her
brother.</p>

<p>“He’s an unfortunate child, lost out of
paradise, at the mercy of careless, cruel
wretches like us below. I never saw a woman
with a nature so spotless.”</p>

<p>“It occurs to me you’re partial to your
Wabash angel,” observed Jack.</p>

<p>Jerome began to play. He was evidently
in his boat plunging with the current. One
could imagine him pressing against his neck
the instrument which holds the saddest possibilities
of sound. It wailed down river,
and ceased. After an interval it began
again up river. Jerome had rowed back
against the current, and he went floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
past the camp once more, pouring through
the violin the vagaries of a mind in double
darkness.</p>

<p>“If the trot-line wasn’t already broken,
he’d break it,” remarked Captain Eric,
“raking back and forth.”</p>

<p>“Fine cheerful banshee for a night like
this,” said Jack.</p>

<p>Lilian huddled by the end of a log, where
she could hear the oozing sap complain.
Again the music died on the river, and
again it began farther up, with an orchestral
support of lashing water and gathering
weather.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it!” she cried out, rising
from her place. “I’m going to my tent.”</p>

<p>“Why did you set Jerome on?” inquired
her brother in surprise. “He never knows
when to quit. I’ll put a stop to it.”</p>

<p>So going close to the shore he shouted
such a peremptory request as virile man
offers to weaklings. He patronized Jerome
also, representing that the water was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
rough for a boy, and recommending the boy
to go home.</p>

<p>Yet hours afterwards when the campfire
smouldered, and the trees were wrestling, Lilian,
sobbing and smothering her face with
her pillow, heard the violin once more, playing
softly in imitation of the wind harp.</p>

<p>Next morning the river was a valley of
black and sulphurous vapors, like a smoking
volcanic fissure. The ague season had undoubtedly
set in. Captain Eric and a squad
of his men rowed their departing guests and
the young lady’s luggage up river to the
steamboat landing, and from this the party
walked to a station in the woods.</p>

<p>There was a bustle about tickets and
checking. The station-master hurried out
of his small general store with the mail-bag
on his arm, for the train was already in
sight.</p>

<p>Miss Brooks’s hair clung in damp rings to
her face. She turned to impress woods and
water stretches upon her mind in one last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
glance, and her lips went white. Behind
her stood Jerome, the porcelain quality of
his face increased tenfold, the blueness of
his eyes pierced by the keen anguish of a
man. She crossed the platform to him, took
his head between her hands, and rising on
tiptoe kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards she was handed
up the railway carriage steps, and Jack was
making a place for her and her traveling
bag. The little station slid away. She had
forgotten to wave to Eric one of the hands
which trembled as she adjusted her belongings
over and over.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word to me,” she commanded,
meeting her lover’s eyes. “I didn’t
know I was going to do it. I intend to
marry you, Jack, because I would rather
have you for a husband than any other man
in the world. But he was my playmate.
He brought back my childhood to me, and
in return I gave him a wound!”</p>

<p>Quite a year passed before she had further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
news of the Babe Jerome. Her brother
moved his camp two days after her
departure, and stayed out until November.
The following summer Lilian and her husband
came face to face with Mr. Marsh in
that magic White City which stood a brief
season beside Lake Michigan. The blue
cape was not around his shoulders, but some
other incongruous garment marked him.
Lilian grasped his hand. He greeted the
young pair. His hairy cheeks were sunken,
and the keenness of his eye appeared dulled.</p>

<p>“Are Jerome and his Aunt Betsey with
you?”</p>

<p>“The Babe has gone off with the quick
consumption that took his mother,” said the
old man, and Lilian became aware that her
nails must be cutting his hand. She gasped,
but could not say a word.</p>

<p>“Yes; Betsey and me’s alone now,” he
pursued. “I brung her up to the World’s
Fair to turn her mind off it.... He never
done well in the new house. I locked it up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
and carried him back to his log cradle. But
the Babe had to go. I took him to Floridy,
and I took him to Colorado.... I hadn’t
orto repine at affliction. He was a good
Babe.... He made a wind harp, like, and
put it in the winder, in the teeth of the air;
and that was all his interest, to listen while
it played.”</p>

<p>Lilian found her husband supporting her,
while water and sky and white palaces and
hurrying people swam giddily in a far-off
circle. She said “Thank you,” and clutched
his arm.</p>

<p>“Sis here, she liked the Babe,” continued
the old father, forced to wipe his eyes on
the corner of a red handkerchief which he
drew half way out of his side pocket.
“And the Babe he liked her. I reelly
thought he was pinin’ sometimes for young
folks; for he done well while you was there....
Billy—you recollect Billy the gander?
He takes it to heart like a dog....
I’m glad I seen you. I was goin’ along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
feelin’ too bitter in my thoughts about the
Babe.”</p>

<p>Silently parting company, the old man
walked on amidst wonders which he scarcely
noticed, and the young pair turned aside
from the crowds.</p>

<p>“Oh Jack!” said Lilian, when she could
control her weeping, “I have killed the
Babe Jerome!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CALHOUN FIDDLER</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1890</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> frost lay on the ferns and
mosses along the Calhoun bluffs, and on that
castellated mass of rock with round turrets
which hangs over the cove known as French
Hollow. From a divide in wooded hills a
small stream came down unfrozen, quivering
over pebbles and clean sand. Crossing an
alluvial plat of ground, it turned beside a
cabin to meet the broad and whispering Illinois.</p>

<p>In all Calhoun County, that long narrow
ridge isolated between two great rivers,
there was not on height or in cove such
another cabin. It was fifty-two feet square
and two stories high, with a Norman projection
of the eaves. The house, with its back
to a road winding at the foot of the bluffs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
sat facing the historic Illinois—a river now
yellow and wrathful with floods, now spreading
in blue or seashell tints away to the opposite
forest.</p>

<p>In the days of old Antoine Dejarnet, the
builder of this log-house and the first Frenchman
who ever set foot in Calhoun County,
hospitality had overflowed the now silent
place. Then there was dancing every Sunday
after mass, in the undivided lower story
like a feudal hall; and the family violin
was coaxed to heavenly tunes by Antoine
Dejarnet himself.</p>

<p>But long before this November afternoon
the French colony in Calhoun County had
dwindled to a remnant; the forty goats
which used to climb those heights or stand
captive to half old Antoine’s many daughters
while the rest milked them, had not a single
descendant; and the last Dejarnet carried
his name locally disfigured into De Zhirley.</p>

<p>Jeanne Sattory, following a road beside
the stream, was coming down the hollow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
The mail-carrier cantered below her toward
Kampsville, riding a nervous pony, and having
the letter pouch strapped behind him.
Twice a week he thus carried news through
Calhoun County, where there are neither railroads
nor telegraph lines, neither banks nor
thieves. But such a courier feels his freedom
and importance; he impudently kissed his
merry finger-tips to the pretty girl up the
slope. She hid behind a rock until he was
out of sight. The mail-carrier had seen this
girl before, and desired to have a closer look
at her. The usual type in Calhoun County
was the broad Dutch maid, whose stock had
superseded the French. But Jeanne Sattory
felt a dread rising to terror of all men. Her
first recollection was of a stepfather who had
made her take to trees like a cat, every time
he approached the dwelling. Her next was
of his son, who finished the small rites of her
mother’s funeral by taking the orphan’s ear
in his grip, leading her to the limit of the
garden patch, and dismissing her, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
threat of a kick if she ever came back there
again. He kept her mother’s own household
goods and the few belongings left by her
father, and nobody took it in hand to interfere
with him. She came back across the
Illinois River to her native county, but even
yet shrank from old Henry Roundcounter,
whose family afforded her a home.</p>

<p>The Rencontres had held land under the
first Dejarnet. As Roundcounters, and farmers
of their own small holding, they now
kept up hereditary interest in that last De
Zhirley who, since his mother’s death, had
lived solitary in the great square cabin. Mrs.
Roundcounter baked bread for him; and
once a week she went down the bluff to tidy
his bachelor hall, except when rheumatism
detained her. This afternoon Jeanne Sattory
was sent reluctantly to the task.</p>

<p>The last De Zhirley was a ferryman; and
it must be owned that voices calling him
from the other side of the river were often
drowned in the music of his fiddle. In clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
summer nights he walked a sandy strip in
front of his cabin, hugging the fiddle beneath
his chin and playing tunes which had come
down from his forefathers.</p>

<p>The ferryboat could now be seen at the
farther bank of the Illinois. Jeanne knew
she might do her work before it could again
cross the current. The cabin door is always
left unfastened in that primitive county.
She noticed a fresh coon skin nailed on the
logs beside the door, as with shrinking she
entered this haunt of man.</p>

<p>The imposing old dancing-hall of the De
Zhirleys gave her a welcome from its ruddy
fireplace hooded with a penthouse. Jeanne’s
first care was to push the embers together,
heap on more of the wood which lay ready,
and clean the stone hearth. She then hung
a pot on the crane, and filled it with spring
water. Before the water was scalding hot
there was time to sweep the floor and beat
up a feather-bed which had grown as hard
as a mat on its corner bedstead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>An unrailed stairway mounted beside the
front wall. Jeanne had heard Mrs. Roundcounter
tell how many little rooms were
overhead, and what stores of family goods
were piled there, disregarded by a young
man who cared for no wife but his fiddle.</p>

<p>No attention could be given to the upper
rooms. Amid all her services, the girl was
full of starts and panics, turning her head
and widening her eyes at any stir without.
She mopped the broad boards worn by foot-marks
of dead dancers; she washed log
imbedded windows and an accumulation of
yellow bowls and pewter; and drew the only
easy chair to the hearth. Something in a
green bag hung on the wall farthest from the
fire, which Jeanne knew to be the De Zhirley
fiddle. She touched it carefully with a
turkey-wing duster, recoiling from its faint
ting as if some charm had been ignorantly
worked.</p>

<p>Dried meat and scarlet peppers, a gun and
powderhorn hung on the richly smoked hewn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
joists. She felt keen, quiet delight in the
place, and reluctance to leave it. The jollity
of former times, perhaps, lingered, making a
fit atmosphere for girlhood.</p>

<p>But she was standing with her shawl over
her head, casting back a last look, when some
hand blundered at the latch outside. She
sprang upstairs and put the first door between
her and the intruder on the lightning
of impulse. Some person entered and seemed
to pause and listen suspiciously. Her heart
labored like the beating of a steamer, and she
expected to hear feet following her up the
stairs. But after uncertain shuffling the
comer dragged a chair, and, with a suggestion
of effort, sat down.</p>

<p>Jeanne knew it could not be young De
Zhirley, whom she had just seen through a
window fighting the current in midriver. He
had a loaded wagon and a pair of restless
mules on board; and he ran back and forth
outside the railing of his boat, now poling,
now steering, and now pulling with a wing-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> 
oar. Jeanne could have been at the top
of the bluff before his return. And here she
was, trapped in an upper room, vaguely
ashamed; unable to come down and face
eyes which might insult her, yet terrified by
the prospect of indefinite hiding.</p>

<p>Daylight’s gradual fading out was of more
interest to her than the accumulation of De
Zhirley things around her. She listened for
the crunch of the ferryboat prow on gravel;
and voices and departing wheels at last
moved by the cabin, and the proper owner
entered. She stealthily unlatched her door
and set it ajar, so the crack intersected the
hearth. There in the seat she had taken
thought to set ready sagged the drunken
person of her stepbrother.</p>

<p>“You here, Billy Aarons?” said young De
Zhirley, as he approached the fire; and his
voice had no joy in it. His blind eye was
toward the stair door, for the Calhoun fiddler
was a one-eyed man. This defacement
scarcely marred the beauty of the athletic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
man thrown out by firelight. Jeanne Sattory
had, indeed, never seen him without pitying
people who were two-eyed. His misused skin
yet held the milk and wine flush of childhood,
and his fleece of red-gold rings was a
gift not to be spoiled.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here, Theodore,” said the man
in the chair thickly.</p>

<p>“Mother Roundcounter has been here
too,” added De Zhirley, as he looked about.
“It makes a feller feel good to see his house
clean and smell new bread.”</p>

<p>He hung a teakettle on the crane, and
thrust a fork through some bacon to toast
on the polished hearthstone. Then he drew
his table toward the fireplace, and Jeanne
could see his appreciative touch on the yellow
ware she had washed.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Billy? Did you
come in to take a bite with me?”</p>

<p>“No.” Aarons stirred from his doze.
“I’m buyin’ cattle, Theodore.”</p>

<p>“No cattle to sell here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“I know it, Theodore. You’re a poor
man by the side of me.”</p>

<p>Indifferent to this fact, De Zhirley turned
his bacon and proceeded to make coffee.</p>

<p>“You’re a poor man, Theodore,” repeated
the heavy guest, “and I’ve got all my father
had.”</p>

<p>“And all his second wife had,” added
young De Zhirley, with a one-eyed glance of
contempt, at which Aarons made a fist.
“You go upstairs and sleep off what’s the
matter with you, after I give you some
coffee.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I come for. You’re a
poor man, Theodore.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let that keep you awake; it
don’t me.”</p>

<p>“You hain’t got no cattle, nor much land,
nor even two eyes.”</p>

<p>“And what do <i>you</i> want on my blind side,
Billy?”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got a fiddle. Yes; you’ve
got a fiddle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>De Zhirley moved back and took his violin
off the wall with a jealous motion. It was
his custom to play while his supper cooked;
but as he felt the bow with his thumb, and
fitted the instrument to his neck, he looked
distrustfully at Aarons.</p>

<p>The first sweet long cry filled the cabin.
The fiddler gradually approached the hearth,
playing as he came, and Aarons’s head,
hands, and feet responded to the magic.</p>

<p>De Zhirley’s back was toward Jeanne, but
she saw joy in his whole bearing, and herself
felt the piercing rapture of sound.</p>

<p>“Let me see that fiddle,” demanded
Aarons, when the young man finished and
put down his bow, and brought the coffee-pot
to set on the coals.</p>

<p>De Zhirley turned a distrustful eye, but
no precious violin toward his guest.</p>

<p>“Let me see that fiddle, I say,” repeated
Aarons, rising up.</p>

<p>“Behave yourself,” said the young man,
standing a head above him, and humoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
him as a child might be humored by half
granting his request.</p>

<p>The fellow handled its ancient body, and
looked at Stradivari’s inscription.</p>

<p>“What’s that there, Theodore?”</p>

<p>“That’s the maker’s name.”</p>

<p>“Seventeen hunderd and—what’s them
figgers?”</p>

<p>“That’s the year it was made.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s a mighty poor old thing,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>The fiddler said nothing, but tried to recover
his violin, to which the tormentor hung
with both hands.</p>

<p>“I can sell it for you, Theodore. It’s
worth fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>De Zhirley’s face expressed impatience to
regain his instrument.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s worth a hunderd dollars. I’ve
been talkin’ with a man, Theodore; that’s
why I come in. You give this fiddle to me,
and I’ll make some money for you. You’re
a poor man, Theodore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Let go of it,” exclaimed De Zhirley. “I
don’t want to sell my fiddle.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth five hunderd dollars.”</p>

<p>“Let go of it! You don’t know what
you’re doing. You ain’t fit to do anything
now. Let go,” cried De Zhirley, as he felt
the greedy, drunken hands crushing his treasure.
“If you don’t let go, I’ll kill you!”</p>

<p>The two men struggled, and there was a
crackling, twanging sound, followed by
Aarons’s curses. Then De Zhirley caught
him by the neck, dragged him to the cabin
door, and kicked him far out into the dusk.</p>

<p>Jeanne hid her face. She heard her stepbrother
battering at the fastened door, and
finally a stone dashed through the window,
to fall with splintered glass upon the floor.
A storm of drunken curses surrounded the
house and died away in mutterings along the
bluff road. Through this clamor an awful
silence made its void in the cabin.</p>

<p>De Zhirley had set his foot upon a chair,
and was nursing the mangled instrument on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
his knee, examining every part. His tense
face denied despair; but the broken neck
hung down by its strings, the chest was
crushed, the back split, the bridge lay beside
his foot. Jeanne watched him, forgetting
the darkness of the bluffs and her dreadful
ambush.</p>

<p>When De Zhirley first came in she had
decided to let herself down from an upper
window rather than face him. When he recommended
her stepbrother to a sleeping-room
upstairs, she looked about in panic for
something which could be made an immediate
rope or ladder. But when she saw the violin’s
destruction, it was to hang outside that
tragedy in a passion of sympathy. She had
been the most solitary creature in Calhoun
County, but this supreme sharing of the
young fiddler’s anguish broke the shell of her
dumbness; she felt her soul spreading out
its crumpled wings like a new butterfly.</p>

<p>He laid the violin on the chair, and with
a sudden abandonment of all restraint shook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
his fists above his head, wailing and sobbing:—</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord, my Lord! What will I do
now?”</p>

<p>It was the agony of an artist, of a lonely
soul, of unspeakable bereavement.</p>

<p>Jeanne wept in her shawl. She had thought
her hunger for the unknown best thing in
the world a singular experience. She waited
until his tears and hers could be wiped off,
and then opened the door and came lightly
downstairs.</p>

<p>De Zhirley huddled his violin again in his
arms, as if dreading the descent of more
drunken men, and, in the embarrassment
and anguish of a man whose weakness has
been spied upon, turned his face to the
hearth. Jeanne stopped at the foot of the
stairs and drew her shawl over her head.
They continued in silence while the coffee
bubbled up and firelight flickered on the
wall.</p>

<p>De Zhirley understood her errand into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
cabin with the simplicity of primitive manhood.
He knew she always took to flight
when her stepbrother appeared. When he
could speak without a sob, he said, acknowledging
all she had done for his comfort that
afternoon:—</p>

<p>“I’m much obleeged.”</p>

<p>Jeanne, on her part, ignored the services.</p>

<p>“Is it bad hurt?” she murmured, with
unconscious maternal pathos.</p>

<p>He offered to yield the wreck to her
hands, and, drawn from her place, she went
and stooped on one knee to the firelight. De
Zhirley dropped on one knee beside her, and
they tried to fit the mangled parts in place
again.</p>

<p>“It’s such a spite,” said Jeanne, and her
trembling voice comforted him as a mother
comforts her child. He had instant anxiety
to make the calamity appear less to her than
it really was.</p>

<p>“Mebby by patchin’ and glue I can put
it together again—though I don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
whether it’ll sound the same. I’ve always
thought so much of it,” he apologized.</p>

<p>“I wish he had broke my neck instead of
this fiddle’s,” said the girl with passion.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him try such a thing as
that,” responded the fiddler sternly. “I’d
killed him as ’twas, if I hadn’t been bigger
than him.”</p>

<p>“I must go back,” exclaimed Jeanne, stirring
to rise from this post-mortem. “They’ll
think I’ve fell in the river.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” said De Zhirley. “It’s
dark now, and that fellow ain’t gone far.”</p>

<p>“No,” objected Jeanne, with sudden terror
of what her neighborhood called a beau.
“I don’t want no one with me.”</p>

<p>De Zhirley took up his cap with gentle
insistence like the courtliness of a great
seignior. He smiled at Jeanne, and she gave
him back a look of which she was unconscious.</p>

<p>“Your supper’s all ready,” she reminded
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“I ain’t hungry like I was when I come
in from the ferry. Won’t you set down and
take supper with me?” invited the young
man sincerely.</p>

<p>The mere suggestion sent Jeanne Sattory
to the door. Their hands mingled upon the
latch, and she slid hers away, loath to part
from a touch which she yet eluded.</p>

<p>De Zhirley made the door pause while he
looked down at her and said, with a shaking
voice:—</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for you—there ain’t
no tellin’.”</p>

<p>Jeanne had no reply to this acknowledgment
of sympathy, but drew her shawl together
under her chin. Chin and mouth corners
were tempting even to a one-eyed
man, but he continued with gentle courtesy:</p>

<p>“Spite of my fiddle’s gettin’ broke, I
b’lieve this is the best day this cabin ever
seen.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“’Cause it’s the first time you ever come
to the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>“I’m obleeged for your politeness,” trembled
Jeanne, turning scarlet; and she lifted
a laughing dark glance. “If you’ll be a
little politer and let me out, I won’t come
no more.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go where you are,” declared
the Calhoun fiddler. “I’ll foller you from
this time on.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to walk on the other side
of the road if you do,” said Jeanne Sattory;
and they stepped out and took the way up
the bluff, two figures indistinct in darkness,
with a width of wagon-track between them.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">A MAN FROM THE SPANISH WAR</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>A conversation in Egypt, which is an undefined
region of Southern Illinois</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>, 1898</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Lucy Mills</span> waited with three
early arrivals in her sitting-room. The rest
of the people would not gather for half an
hour. Her wide house, venerable for the
region in which it stood, hugged by vines
and mossy roofed, was in perfect order; and
sheaves of flowers exhaled fragrance around
an object placed in the centre of her parlor.
Neighbors no longer trod about on tiptoe,
for everything was ready, and the minister
might arrive at any moment.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy sat a dignified spinster, whose
sympathies ramified through the entire human
race. She was so homely that strangers
turned to look at her as at a beauty. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
Sammy Blade was in his thirties, but she
considered him a youth, having helped his
mother to nurse him through measles and
whooping-cough. Mr. Sammy had a protruding
pointed beard and rolled his silly
bald head on his shoulders when he talked.
He had studied medicine but, failing of
practice, was turning his attention to the
peddling of fruit-trees. Coming home and
hearing the news, he hastened to appear at
Miss Lucy’s house.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Plankson had returned to
the neighborhood to visit. The husband was
a frisky gray little man, and his wife was a
jimp woman in stiff black silk with large
lips and shifty eyes.</p>

<p>All three of Miss Lucy’s callers coughed
and made the unconscious grimaces of plain
people who have not learned the art of expression.
They sat with their hands piled
on their stomachs. Yet while they longed to
get at facts which only Miss Lucy knew, they
approached these facts roundabout, bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
newsy bits of their own, and avoiding by
common instinct the subject of war with
Spain.</p>

<p>“Have you heard that Emeline Smith’s
oldest girl has experienced religion?” inquired
Mr. Sammy solemnly, breaking the
silence of the down-sitting after greetings.</p>

<p>“No, I hadn’t heard it,” responded Miss
Lucy, in the soft slow drawl which her candid
speech made its vehicle.</p>

<p>“Law me!” exclaimed Mrs. Plankson,
“Emeline Smith was always a great hand
for revivals. If she had went less to meetings
and had saw more to do in her own
house, her children would be better brung
up.”</p>

<p>“Seem-me-like there is some spite-work
against Emeline Smith amongst the women,”
observed Mr. Plankson. “I was a
beau of Emeline’s onct. I went to see her
the other day, and she laughed, and waved
the broom, and acted so glad Jane can’t get
over it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“You orto married her,” said Mrs. Plankson
crisply. “You’d be richer than you
are. Her mother was the savin’est person
I ever heard of. She give a tea-party one
time, and the milk floated in lumps on top
the cups. She said she didn’t see how it
could be sour, when she had put saleratus in
it and boiled it twice! Them Smiths got
their money from a rich old aunt, that used
to cut up squares of tissue paper to make
handkerchiefs. I seen her one time myself,
when she was a-visiting the Smiths, come to
meeting with a wreath of live geranium
leaves around her bonnet, in winter, and
them leaves all bit black with the cold!
We’ve heard she would set before the parlor
fire in city hotels where she boarded, with
her dress turned up on her knees, showing
her little sticks of legs in narrow pantalets
and white stockings, just to save fire in her
room—and young ladies obliged to receive
young men, with her a-setting there!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sammy coughed gently, for Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
Plankson had overlooked his presence in her
wrath against Emeline Smith’s relations.</p>

<p>To cover the situation her husband directly
inquired, “What’s become of them
Ellison girls, seven sisters, that all dressed
alike and carried umberellas the same color?
They used to walk into church in Indian
file. I never in my life seen them go two
or three abreast.”</p>

<p>“They all live where they used to and
look like they always did. For they was
born old-like. Carline,” said Miss Lucy,
“took to herb doctorin’. Along about the
time that President Garfield was shot, Carline
got very dissatisfied. ‘I know just
what would fetch that bullet out,’ she used
to say, ‘and the only thing that would fetch
it out.’”</p>

<p>“And what was that?” inquired Mr.
Sammy, rounding his lips and stretching his
short neck forward.</p>

<p>“Spearmint tea!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Plankson beat her right palm softly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
on her left forearm and leaned over, shaking.
It would not have been decorous to
cackle out loud. The American flag and its
Cuban little sister, draped together around
the wide doorway of the parlor, swayed in
the air. She glanced through the open portal,
her oblique eyes slanting up to Miss
Lucy’s hanging lamp decorated with feathery
asparagus.</p>

<p>“Carline told my niece,” Mrs. Plankson
added to the Ellison subject, “why she
never got married.”</p>

<p>“Did she have a disappointment?” inquired
Mr. Sammy, as one of the younger
generation, who fully sensed a woman’s loss
in not obtaining a companion like himself.</p>

<p>“No. ‘Do you know,’ says she to my
niece, ‘why I never got married?’ ‘No,’
says my niece, ‘I don’t.’—‘Tew skittish!’
says Carline.”</p>

<p>“I never seen such a neighborhood as this
is for old maids!” exclaimed Mr. Plankson.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy regarded him with a virgin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
pitying tolerance. Homely as she was, she
thought it would have been impossible for
her to have taken up with the likes of William
Plankson in his best days.</p>

<p>“There has been too much marryin’ and
givin’ in marriage in this neighborhood,”
she declared with her soft drawl.</p>

<p>“Seem-me-like you ain’t no good judge
of that, Lucy,” bantered Mr. Plankson.</p>

<p>“It’s Emeline Smith that’s the judge,”
thrust in his wife.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy contemplated silently.</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ of Jaw-awn and Sue
Emma,” she said; and the other three composed
themselves to hear the facts concerning
the man from the Spanish war. With
a rustle like that of a congregation settling
to the sermon after preliminaries, they moved
their feet and hands and waited on Miss
Lucy.</p>

<p>“I was against the match, for Sue Emma
had been married, and was through with it.
Her man died and left her with a farm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
two children; and a widow well fixed is a
sight better off than a married woman.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Plankson gave involuntary assent
and then glanced with oblique apprehension
at her husband, whose will was made in her
favor.</p>

<p>“But Sue Emma wasn’t of Yankee stock
like the Ellison girls. She felt pestered to
get along by herself.”</p>

<p>“Seem-me-like a man always is needed on
a farm,” put in Mr. Plankson.</p>

<p>“Sue Emma thought that-a-way. But I
talked reel plain to her when she took up
with Jaw-awn. I hadn’t nothing against
Jaw-awn, except he was a man. He was
without property, but he was mighty good
to Sue Emma and the children. Seem-like
he thought as much of the children as he did
of her. And when they had been married a
couple of years and the new baby come, Jaw-awn
would have been tickled to death if it
hadn’t been for losin’ it and Sue Emma.
Now that woman might have been livin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
to-day if she had let men alone. But Jaw-awn
was a great hand for his folks. I
thought he would go crazy. Seem-like he
could neither lay nor set when he come home
from buryin’ Sue Emma and the baby; but
just wandered around, Lolly Loo and the
little boy holdin’ one onto each of his hands.”</p>

<p>“Lolly Loo?” challenged Mrs. Plankson.
“What-for name is that?”</p>

<p>“Laura Louise; but they called her Lolly
Loo. Jaw-awn nacherly had to have folks
to do for. I believe he would have got
along reel well with the children, if he had
been let alone; for he was a good manager.</p>

<p>“But Sue Emma’s father and mother
moved right onto the place after the funeral,
and the first thing they done was to turn
Jaw-awn out. I suppose he had rights in
law, but he didn’t make no stand for rights;
what he seemed to want was folks. He’d
been an orphan-like, without father or
mother, and knocked around the world and
got kind of homesick clean through. Gettin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
Sue Emma and her children was the
same to him as comin’ into a fortune, and
when he was throwed out of them he give up.</p>

<p>“The children, they felt terrible, for they
thought so much of Jaw-awn; and cried
and begged.</p>

<p>“‘Jaw-awn won’t be no trouble, grammaw,’
says Lolly Loo. ‘I can cook enough
for Jaw-awn to eat, if you let him stay.’</p>

<p>“But the old couple, they up and throwed
him out. And when he stopped here on his
way to Springfield I could see the man was
clean broke down.</p>

<p>“The very next thing, along come this
excitement about war with Spain, and I seen
Jaw-awn’s name among the volunteers. I
knowed he wouldn’t ever get through the
war. Sure enough, word come—. I telegraphed
to have him sent here. I knowed
the children’s grandpaw and grandmaw
wouldn’t do it. And I sent them word,
but they don’t want to excite the children,
so none of that family will come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>“I don’t say nothing about the expense:
I have some means. But when I think of
them children that he was a father to—him
being so wrapped up in his folks—and
them slippin’ to the bars like they do to see
if Jaw-awn is comin’ back and not even
knowin’ that he lays a soldier in his coffin
in that parlor—without any folks to drop
a tear on him—I feel like as if things was
wrong!”</p>

<p>Miss Lucy arose and entered the parlor.
She rearranged the American and Cuban
flags which draped the plain casket, and
touched the flowers and a huge wreath bearing
the initials G. A. R.</p>

<p>Her three guests followed her in silent
awe. She had wiped her eyes and was
ready to add,—</p>

<p>“The minister has took for his text, ‘He
setteth the solitary in families.’ I hope
everybody will turn out. The weather is
nice. Some will come because he is the
first soldier buried here from the Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
war, and the Grand Army Post has took it
up and will march and fire a salute over his
grave. I don’t know as the dead care anything
about it, but I’d kind of like to see
Jaw-awn have as nice a funeral as if he had
folks.”</p>
